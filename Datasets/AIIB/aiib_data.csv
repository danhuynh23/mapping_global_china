The pandemic has driven up unemployment and poverty levels in Indonesia. The adverse impact of reduced working hours, lockouts and unemployment caused a reversal of the structural transformation of the economy. The risk of a prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic could further stall economic development. While domestic consumption has been the main driver of economic growth, it is likely to remain dampened due to the income loss experienced by households. In the post-pandemic context for Indonesia to meet its target of becoming a high-income country by 2045, critical reforms are needed to address productivity, creation of quality jobs, and income growth.   The proposed Program is anchored on GoI’s structural reforms, combining reforms in the investment, trade, and MSMEs (micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises) sectors. The proposed Program will support the following three reform areas: (i) Reform 1 (creating an enabling environment for investments) - this reform area aims to improve the business climate;  (ii) Reform 2 (easing barriers to trade) - this reform area will reduce impediments to trading, both domestic and cross-border; and (iii) Reform 3 (growing and upscaling enterprises) - this reform area will help firms increase their productivity and upscale operations.",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,Republic of Indonesia ,500,Approved Financing: USD500 million

The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the Government’s developmental wave and has left long-term impacts. Aside from the economic contraction, the pandemic also resulted in significant social sector losses which mostly affected the poorest and most vulnerable. For the country to achieve economic recovery that is resilient, and inclusive, there is a need to focus on new development drivers including digitalization.
Digitalization has a large potential to increase productivity by reducing firms’ operational costs and allowing them to reap economies of scale. First, digitalization can increase the efficiency and transparency of government services and empower its constituents, especially those previously distant from the center of decision-making. Digital platforms and services offer great potential for helping build resilience and preparedness against future crises and for mitigating and adapting to climate change (World Bank Development Committee paper, 2022). Second, digital finance is a key enabler of financial inclusion and women’s empowerment. Third, aggregate productivity can be raised by facilitating new and emerging firms to enter markets through disruptive innovations. Finally, digitalization expands firms’ market access as it decreases information constraints and transaction costs, which are particularly binding for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Higher operational efficiency and access to wider and more diversified markets, in turn, render firms more resilient against shocks.
The DPF builds on the nation’s long-term vision articulated in “AmBisyon Natin 2040”, and the recently launched Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 to achieve inclusive growth. It is structured along the following three thematic pillars: - Pillar A: Improve digital government service delivery, and pro-competition infrastructure policies. - Pillar B: Expand financial inclusion for individuals and businesses through digital finance. - Pillar C: Boost business growth in digital services.",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,Republic of the Philippines,400,Approved Financing: USD400 million

2023,Argentina,Energy,Sovereign,Argentina: Tierra del Fuego Energy Transition Support ProgramVIEW DETAILS,Approved,To increase the renewable wind power generation capacity in Tierra del Fuego Province.,"The Province of Tierra del Fuego (“the Province”) is an insular territory located in the south of the country. The provincial network is isolated from the national electricity grid SADI (""Sistema Argentino de Interconexión”) and made up of city grids (Rio Grande and Ushuaia), which results in a fragile network requiring specific consideration for green transition. The current energy mix of the Province is made up of 100 percent fossil fuel, specifically natural gas, which is scarce and costly. The current stock of electricity generators in the province is generally obsolete and inefficient and has urgent needs for maintenance and rehabilitation.
The Province of Tierra del Fuego has rich wind resources and therefore great potential for wind generation. However, to date, no wind energy project has materialized. Given the disconnected status of local grids, wind farms need to be built together with modernized and more flexible thermal plants, so that both thermal and renewable generations can be duly integrated. By implementing such a plan, the Province can diversify its energy supply mix, improve energy efficiency, reduce gas consumption and achieve its goal of clean energy transition.
Partnering with CAF who will support the modernization of the two thermal power plants, AIIB will support the construction of a wind farm located in Río Grande. The AIIB loan is expected to finance: (1) the procurement, transportation and installation of eight wind power turbines, with an individual capacity of 4.2 MW for each turbine and a total installed capacity of 33.6MW; (2) the interconnection line to the 33Kv local electric power distribution system (including fiber-optic cable network); (3) project feasibility studies.",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,Tierra del Fuego Province,65,Approved Financing: USD65 million

The Project will finance similar structural retrofitting and reconstruction of priority public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and other social facilities.
Recently, the IPCU has identified the backlog of 69 additional educational buildings, built prior to 1999, that were found to be unsafe and not in compliance with the seismic resilient building code at various level. Preliminary study shows that for many buildings retrofitting are not technically and economically feasible. Therefore, reconstruction of these buildings will be required after demolition of the old structures. Feasibility study reports that these additional buildings are being carried out and funded by the KfW Development Bank (KfW).
Similar to the previous ISMEP project financed by AIIB, this additional financing Project comprises of three components as shown below.
Component A: Enhancing Emergency Preparedness This component aims to enhance the emergency preparedness of the City of Istanbul by strengthening the capacity of Istanbul’s Provincial Directorate of Disaster and Emergency and other first responders.
Component B: Seismic Risk Mitigation for Public Facilities This component is to reduce the risk of future earthquake damages to critical public facilities in order to save lives and ensure their continued functioning operation in the event of an earthquake.

2023,Jordan,CRF-Economic Resilience/PBF,Sovereign,"Jordan: Additional Financing for Inclusive, Transparent and Climate Responsive Investments ProgramVIEW DETAILS",Approved,To further improve accountability to foster climate responsive investments and growth in Jordan by extending and scaling up post-COVID recovery activities.,"The original Program of USD250 million, co-financed with the World Bank, was approved by AIIB’s Board of Directors on August 26, 2021, and became effective on November 15, 2021, with an objective to improve accountability to foster climate responsive investments and growth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It consists of three results areas (RAs): (i) improving the accountability and fiscal space for public investment, including towards national climate goals; (ii) improving business enabling environment and the capacity of key institutions to attract private investment and climate finance, including for tourism sector; and (iii) generating evidence and data for policy making, implementation, and stakeholder dialogue. AIIB financing is involved in RA 1 and RA 2 only. 
The original Program has achieved strong results in the first year of implementation, with notable progress on Program objective-level indicators, most disbursement-linked results (DLRs) for 2021 and 2022 met and disbursements ahead of schedule. Despite its strong performance, the original Program has been impacted by challenges experienced in 2022, such as high food and fuel prices. The challenges led GOJ to reallocate fiscal resources to social protection and subsidies at the cost of capital spending. Also, timebound DLRs on investment incentives and promotion should be revised to align with the enacted legal provisions of the 2022 Investment Environment law and 2023 subsidiary legislation, including with regard to targeted investment incentives to promote participation of Jordanian women in the workforce. In October 2022, the Government of Jordan requested AIIB to provide an AF of USD200 million to scale up the operation and restructure the original Program in light of the recent institutional reorganization and policy shifts in the past year. In parallel, the Government requested for USD 400 million from the World Bank, the lead co-financier of the original Program. The Loan from the World Bank was already approved in April 2023. 
The proposed AF aims to enhance the development effectiveness and fiscal sustainability of public investment, to increase support to climate responsive public and private investment, including by mobilizing green financing and climate finance, to create job and business opportunities for women, and to improve government effectiveness and social accountability through participatory policy making based on data.

The Project entity and Borrower of the loan is Nakkaş Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (the Borrower).
Upon completion, the Project is expected to significantly enhance economic activity of the Istanbul region and contribute to its socio-economic development. As an integral part of the NMH, the Project will also contribute to enhance the east-west road connectivity of the Marmara Region with Europe, as well as with Central Anatolia and the Aegean regions, where the majority of Türkiye’s industrial activity concentrates. Given its urban nature, the Project is expected to positively impact the city’s road network and facilitate its decongestion. Positive effects such as higher vehicle average speeds, shorter journey times, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improvement in overall road safety conditions are expected.
The Project will also contribute to the uptake of electric vehicles (EV) through the provision of EV charging stations, apply energy efficient technologies like LED lighting and LED information panels, and implement a smart motorway management and monitoring system to support the efficient operation and maintenance of the highway.
The Project incorporates climate change resilience and geotechnical factors in the design of the road and the cable-stayed bridge. Improved design applications, such as elevation of ground level, use of stone mastic asphalt (SMA) and increased culvert and drainage capacity will improve the climate resilience of the Project in the face of extreme heat, flood, landslide, winds, and wildfires, among other incidents. The evaluation of climate resilience aspects was done in accordance with the Joint MDB Methodology for Tracking Adaptation Finance.�",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,Nakkaş Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş.,125 ,Proposed Funding: EUR125 million

The proposed Program will support the government measures and financing needs, and mitigate the adverse social and economic impacts on the Mongolian people by providing targeted assistance to poor and vulnerable groups, including women and girls.
Due to its high dependence on trade with its two large neighbors, China and Russia, Mongolia is one of the most severely affected economies by the twin shocks created by COVID-19 containment policies and the multiple macroeconomic pressures. The exposure to these twin shocks has adversely impacted Mongolia’s economy and its population.
The current international environment is characterized by disrupted global economic conditions, increasing challenges in financial and commodity markets, and inflationary pressures on energy and food prices. Economic growth forecast for Mongolia in 2022 was considerably downgraded from 6% p.a. made in September 2021 to only 1% p.a. real GDP growth in July 2022, according to the IMF. The situation is having severe economic impacts in Mongolia, particularly for the 27.8% of households already below the poverty line, with a further 14.9% of people at risk of falling into poverty.
Against this backdrop, the government has prepared a countercyclical development expenditure program (CDEP) to help vulnerable groups, tame inflationary pressure, and support macroeconomic stabilization. The approved budget for 2022 was amended in two occasions to strengthen the critical measures to address the impacts of the twin shocks.

2021,Azerbaijan,CRF-Economic Resilience/PBF,Sovereign,Azerbaijan: Republic of Azerbaijan COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) ProgramVIEW DETAILS,Approved,"The Program’s objective is to support the Government of Azerbaijan’s fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the population’s health, incomes, and economic opportunities as well as macroeconomic stability.","Azerbaijan economy has experienced economic contraction of 4.3 percent in 2020 led mainly by the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in oil prices combined with oil production cut due to the agreement with OPEC+ countries. These two external shocks and comprehensive government responses to COVID-19 pandemic have led to widening of fiscal position, relative to the GDP, from a surplus of 8.2 percent in 2019 to a deficit of 6.3 percent in 2020 and 5.8 percent in 2021. Due to sound macroeconomic management Azerbaijan’s pegged foreign exchange regime has remained stable with the exchange rate of AZN 1.70 to the USD, despite severe economic shocks.
Since the first COVID-19 case was confirmed on February 28, 2020, there were 335,568 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 4,963 deaths, as of June 23, 2021. Starting in early March 2021, a new surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases has led the Government to tighten the restriction of public activities to contain and reduce the spread of the disease. Despite the recent improvement in the Azerbaijan’s public-sector-led healthcare system in providing universal basic medical care in public hospitals, the growing number of COVID-19 cases has placed significant stress on the initial testing and diagnosis, prevention, and treatment capacity of the system due to inadequate specialized medical facilities, staff, and equipment. Essential health services for emergency care, chronic illnesses and surgical procedures have been challenged due to prioritization on the pandemic.
To mitigate the adverse socioeconomic impacts of COVD-19 pandemic, an inter-agency COVID-19 Task Force chaired by the Prime Minister was established along with working groups under key ministries. The government approved the first Action Plans on January 30, 2020. Following the President’s Executive Decree on 19 March 2020, the government has allocated AZN 3.5 billion (USD 2.06 billion or 4.8 percent of GDP) to implement the pro-poor countercyclical pandemic response package, covering Health-related, Social Protection and Macroeconomic Stabilization measures. In responding to the recent surge of new COVID-19 cases in 2021, the government has recently approved an additional budget of USD 1.77 billion (3.6 percent of GDP) to extend and expand the implementation of the countercyclical pandemic response program that has started in 2020.
Due to the deteriorating fiscal situation, the total fiscal deficit is expected to reach USD 2.61 billion in 2021, of which the domestic financing will cover USD 2.26 billion, while the external financing will be USD 350 million, closing the financing gap. Through the ADB COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure support (CARES) program under the Countercyclical Support Facility Option (CPRO), ADB has prepared to finance USD 250 million while AIIB has been requested by the Government to provide USD 100 million of sovereign-back financing to bridge the financing gap. The Government will finance the rest of the pandemic response package of USD 1.42 billion.
The proposed program structure comprises of three Countercyclical COVID-19 Pandemic Response Measures:
A. Enhancement the Government’s COVID-19 response and health system;
B. Expansion of social protection for the poor and vulnerable; and
C. Assistance to impacted economic sectors to prevent job losses from economic downturn due to COVID-19 mitigation and prevention measures.",,,100,Approved Financing: USD100 million

2020,Cook Islands,CRF-Economic Resilience/PBF,Sovereign,Cook Islands: COVID-19 Active Response and Economic Support ProgramVIEW DETAILS,Approved,The Program supports the Government of the Cook Islands to reduce the adverse impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on the population and businesses.,"This Program is proposed under the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (the Facility) of the Bank and will be supported by a Sovereign-backed Loan to the Cook Islands, co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID). The ADB co-financing is provided under ADB's Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO). The Program is designed to promote social protection and economic resilience to prevent long-term damage to the productive capacity, including human capital, of the Cook Islands’ economy.
The Cook Islands are one of the smallest and most remote nations in the Pacific Ocean. The economy remains heavily dependent on imports. Future growth is hampered by high cost structures, small population and high exposure to climate impacts and disasters. The Cook Islands are among the most tourism-driven economies in the world, with tourism revenues exceeding 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The economy enjoyed sustained growth averaging 5 percent between FY2012 and FY2019 as visitor arrivals rose from 113,000 in 2011 to over 170,000 in 2019.
The Cook Islands avoided a COVID-19 outbreak within its borders with the GOCI taking preemptive actions and implementing a quick containment response. In Jan. 2020, the Ministry of Health (the MOH) activated the Health Emergency Response System. From March 2020, all primary healthcare services were relocated away from the main hospitals. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic and on March 24, 2020, the GOCI closed the country’s borders. Widespread testing, mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions and social distancing were enforced during the ensuing lockdown period which began mid-March 2020. The GOCI declared the country COVID-19 free on April 16, 2020.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant economic threat to the Cook Islands. Due to the shutdown of tourism, the economy is estimated to have contracted by 7 percent in FY20 and projected to further contract by 15.4 percent in FY21, or more if borders remain closed to New Zealand tourists beyond early 2021. The impact on business viability has been severe. The impact on the fiscal position will be significant. In addition to higher expenditures, which will temporarily increase from 36 percent of GDP in FY19 to over 70 percent of GDP in FY21, the collapse in tourism has led to a decline in tax revenues of 7 percent in FY20 and a further expected decline by almost 40 percent in FY21. As a result, the fiscal deficit in FY20 was 2.4 percent of GDP (instead of 1.2 percent planned), and for FY21 it is projected by the ADB to reach 30 percent of GDP or more.",,,20,Approved Financing: USD20 million

The Program supports the Government of Fiji’s (GOF) 2020 – 2021 budget, that includes a response to COVID-19 to mitigate the extreme public health emergency and ensuing unprecedented economic crisis. The Program will provide budget support to strengthen public finance for public health containment and treatment measures and a fiscal stimulus with a focus on social and economic protection.
With 67% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the country coming from the service sector with tourism contributing up to 40%, the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing the country to a halt.

The Program will enable the GoP to effectively manage COVID-19 outbreak and reduce its immediate social and economic damages.,"This Program is proposed to be supported under the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (the Facility) of the Bank and co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a policy-based loan under ADB’s Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO).
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted Pakistan’s ability to continue with the ongoing economic recovery program initiative and sustain high and inclusive growth. ADB estimates that both exports and remittances will decline by USD 2 billion during FY2020. Total revenue is expected to decline by almost USD 6 billion and will contribute maximum to Pakistan higher fiscal deficit of 2 percent during FY2020. All the above impacts have already led to significant job losses—both in the formal and the informal sectors.
The Government of Pakistan (GoP) has acted quickly to approve a health sector and counter-cyclical development expenditure program. Total countercyclical development expenditure package of $7.2 billion consists of three broad areas to support: health measure, social safety net measure and economic stimulus measures. Additionally, GoP has also approved a comprehensive COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness & Response Plan (Plan) including $595 million in financing for priority activities on 23 April 2020. These expenditure allocations contain specific strategies for protecting the poor and vulnerable, including women; augmenting the health sector capacity and supplies; and protecting productive sectors and small businesses from economic downturn. AIIB’s financing under CARES program is provided through general budgetary support for the purpose of meeting gaps in the GoP’s development financing needs.",,,500,Approved Financing: USD500 million

2020,Mongolia,CRF-Economic Resilience/PBF,Sovereign,Mongolia: COVID-19 Rapid Response ProgramVIEW DETAILS,Approved,The Program objective is to mitigate the severe adverse economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and support poverty alleviation through budgetary support to the government’s countercyclical development expenditure program.,"This program is proposed to be supported under AIIB’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility and co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a policy-based loan under its Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO). The program will provide critically needed support to assist the Government of Mongolia in mitigating the severe adverse health, social, and economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mongolia has taken proactive and decisive actions in response to the COVID pandemic and kept the number of COVID-19 cases low. However, its vulnerability to the pandemic remains, as the Government has identified that about 20% of its population, especially the poor and other vulnerable groups, are at high risk due to the strained healthcare system. Meanwhile, the pandemic triggered severe economic slowdown in the country. Mongolia’s economy has limited diversification and is highly dependent on the mining sector, which accounts for 24% of its gross domestic product (GDP) and almost 90% of its exports. Its high dependency on trade makes the country particularly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government of Mongolia has put together a comprehensive set of response measures to mitigate the COVID-19 impact. The measures include the Countercyclical Development Expenditure Program (CDEP), which consists of three packages: (1) support to public health protection; (2) social protection to support citizens and businesses; and (3) support to vulnerable businesses and fiscal stimulus measures.
The proposed Mongolia COVID-19 Rapid Response Program (the Program) will assist the government’s response to COVID-19 pandemic, support the implementation of its CDEP to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the economy, and support poverty alleviation.

Specifically, the program will help the government to support the worst-hit industries, including the export-oriented industries and SMEs and expand and strengthen its social safety net for the vulnerable groups.
 
Expected Results:
The program is expected to mitigate the potential economic shock from the COVID-19 pandemic by extending onward assistance to the industries and the vulnerable groups.
(i) By June 2022, national poverty incidence maintained at the 2019 level of 20.5% (Baseline: 20.5% in 2019)
(ii) By March 2021, 15 million poor and vulnerable people (of whom at least 40% are women) benefitted from at least one economic assistance program under the government’s coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response plan (May 2020 baseline: 0)
(iii) By September 2020, at least 1.5 million workers (of whom at least 50% are women) in export-oriented industries benefitted from extended salary support through the program (May 2020 baseline: 0)
(iv) By December 2021, at least Tk170 billion (i.e equivalent approximate USD 2 billion) in loans with subsidized interest provided to the affected industries and sectors and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. (May 2020 baseline: 0)","This Program is proposed to be supported under the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (the Facility) of the Bank and co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as a policy-based loan under ADB’s Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO). Being a densely populated country with a large number of internal and external migrant workers, Bangladesh is very vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. The country has already faced significant healthcare challenges in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases in the country has been significantly increasing; as of May 6, 2020, number of confirmed cases are 11,719. On Mar 25, 2020, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) imposed a lockdown which has been extended till May 30, 2020, and is likely to extend further as this crisis continues to evolve rapidly, and the ultimate fallout is difficult to predict.
The pandemic has seriously impacted the country’s economy. The extended closure of business establishments and offices as well as other social distancing measures result in simultaneous supply and demand shocks, with production, consumption, trade and investment all at a standstill. The traditional growth engines of the country’s economy – export-oriented industries, remittances and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have all ground to a halt. As a result, the poor and the vulnerable will likely bear the brunt of the impact. Thus, the GoB has undertaken fiscal countercyclical expenditure programs to strengthen healthcare services, and provide direct support for the poor and vulnerable groups and for businesses to protect jobs.
The Program is expected to increase GoB’s spending on crisis measures with a focus on social and economic protection. The following key outputs are expected: (i) employment opportunities are protected; and (ii) social safety net to vulnerable groups expanded.",,,250,Approved Financing: USD250 million

In response, the Government of Indonesia (GoI) has formulated a strong pro-poor countercyclical expenditure plans, with estimated total value of USD 32.4 billion, that will fund substantial increase in public health measures, social assistances to the poor and vulnerable, and supports to businesses especially micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). This includes the national recovery program, which will target real and finance sectors amounting to USD8.9 billion. A key component of the fiscal measures is to support enterprises especially affected micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
