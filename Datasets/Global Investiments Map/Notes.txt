Note that here, there is a number of projects with clearly wrong latitude / longitude (if you go here https://platform.mapglobalchina.com/global-investments-map and click to see only BRI countries, you will see a lot of projects for Congo that are in the US. That can be due to swap of latitude and longitude- but you gotta investigate it). There are more projects with clearly wrong coordinates, worth exploring.
