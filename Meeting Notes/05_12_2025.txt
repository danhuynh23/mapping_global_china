NOTES:

- Dan & Amanda: Scrapped data from AIIB website, still trying to get information from "View Details" so the information is more accurate
- Send scrapped csv to Nika and Meyhar
- Nika & Meyhar: Took qualitative notes addressing questions in how to handle the dataset
- Main question: How to categorize status of project in broader categories? (Just completed not sufficient)
- Challenge of aggregating: conceptual, how to combine, decisions up to us (decide and justify as we go)
- AIIB investment that goes to China IS NOT considered FDI (keep the information because we still want to be able to access that)


MAIN TASKS 

- Set up meeting 4 of us, get each other up to speed on our work
- Finalize cleaning and merging of FDI: Put up geolocation, change column names, change sector names.
- Find a way to finish scrapping data from AIIB.
- Ideally be ready to launch FDI dataset by June.
- Ideally write a short report (half to one page) about challenges on how to proceed in this merge.
