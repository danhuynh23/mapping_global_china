NOTES:

- Geolocation
- Check project completion (was it cancelled by china/country, ongoing, completed)
- Projecting lines and roads (infrastructure) 
- Infrastructure or investment or project? 
- Material vs imaterial FDIs
- Maybe filter by amount (<5Billion, extract) 
- Pick largest amounts and draw it (probably exists in other databases)
- Data: trying to trace key corridors China wants to build -> maybe useless

MAIN TASKS 

- Geolocation wrong
- Project canceled
- Same lines to the same target (aggregate)
- Eliminate duplicates
- General check for correctness
- Sort by size, look at biggest values amounts
- See anything from X to Y and draw a line (type: infrastructure & transportation projects): already exists in the data, connect them or understand where the project is intended to go
- Add number of total projects in one country 
- Average of money by project 


MY IDEAS
- For ongoing projects, add "percentage timeline", calculated by the amount of time spent since the beginning of the project/expected time to complete the project(according to contract/china's promise)
	-For visualization, that could work as a piechart with the completed percentage highlighted and not completed faded
