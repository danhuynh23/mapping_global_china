NOTES:

- get intersection between datasets 
- If status is abandoned (delete or make gray, flag it somehow)
- Combine rows (sum investments) that are investments of same project - ONE THE MAP, NOT ON THE DATASET
- Exclude columns (not in original, have an output) that aren't relevant to project
- Focus on one dataset first 
- When compiling a new dataset, map columns of new to old (check for names, e.g.: industry=sector)
- NEED DATASET AND VARIABLE DESCRIPTION BEFOREHAND
- Tracker = 12 sectors -> New dataset must adapt to the same names
- Keep looking at other databases for section (columns) definitions
- YEAR: Probably for announced 
- Search by recipient to see which projects are going towards the same target
- Coordinates are according to recipient, geolocate to headquarters if the geolocation is not a physical location.
- Note for projects with no location

MY IDEAS
- Take csv with geolocations to contrast with the tracker one to get wrong lat/long
- Check how many recipients are NAs
-
