The Project has been categorized as Category A in accordance with ESP because large-scale land acquisition leading to economic displacement. To facilitate a harmonized application of AIIB's and International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) ES policies under the Project, the project’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the requirements of AIIB's ESP (as well as IFC's ES policies).Environmental and Social Instruments.The primary assessment instrument is a Supplementary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (SESIA) including an integrated Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), a Rapid Cumulative Impact Assessment (RCIA) and a Non-Technical Summary (NTS). Key management instruments are Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP); Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP); Construction Environmental and Social Management System (CESMS) including risk-specific procedures; Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP); and Resettlement Action Plan Framework (RAPF).Environmental Aspects. The propagation of noise from the operational railway and its impacts on residents living close by is the primary issue of concern identified. The SESIA concluded that approximately 22 properties in total, located around Zhetygen and Kazybek Bek stations could be subject to operational noise changes above acceptable limits. KTZ has identified feasible options for reducing worst-case rail noise at impacted receptors. These include potential for noise barriers of 2.25 km at Zhetygen Station and 1 km at Kazybek Bek Station and sound proofing of properties as described in the supplementary ESIA. The final specification and composition of noise mitigation measures will be informed by a program of additional longer-duration baseline noise measurements and updated noise modelling, and the effectiveness of mitigations will be monitored. The Project crosses a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) for around 5 km. A biodiversity impact assessment including critical habitat assessment (CHA) was completed for the SESIA. These concluded that no critical habitat will be impacted. A BMP that sets out mitigation to achieve no net loss for natural habitats and an associated program of monitoring has been prepared. In addition, KTZ has appointed a biodiversity specialist for the management, implementation and reporting of activities undertaken within the scope of the BMP. Other potential environmental risks and impacts during construction of the Project are standard and include dust, groundwater use and hazardous materials and waste management. Risks are managed through a Construction Environmental and Social Management System (CESMS). Operations phase aspects include water consumption and disposal and managing hazardous materials and wastes. The Borrower will address operations phase aspects through a corporate ESMS.Social Aspects. The Project through the local district governments (Akimats), initiated a land acquisition process to acquire approximately 1,056.43 ha of land in İliy, Karasay, Talgar and Zhambyl districts and Alatau city as per national laws and regulations in 2023. During the preparation of SESIA, 70 plots (31.9%) have already been acquired, 19 land plots (8.6%) were under court cases while 92 plots (42%) are still pending acquisition. Additionally, 38 plots (17.5%) do not require acquisition, mainly because they fall under either state-owned land under lease or considered insignificant in size hence voluntarily donated upon negotiation with the landowner. Also, there are 22 structures identified for acquisition in Alatau City, including 13 residential houses and 9 barns or small shops, which were unoccupied at the time of SESIA in January 2025. KTZ completed two studies: (i) Report on Gap Analysis Between Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy and Procedures of the Government of Kazakhstan and IFC PS5 Requirements, in September 2024, to assess the gaps between the procedures and processes used for acquisition of land and IFC’s PS5; and ii) LRP including RAPF in February 2025 within the scope of SESIA. KTZ will commission a competent resettlement consultant to implement the LRP and RAP consistent with the RAPF to manage the physical relocation of the 13 to 15 households in Alatau city in compliance with AIIB ESS 2 and IFC PS5 requirements.Gender Aspects. The SESIA has carried out consultations with women and vulnerable groups. The consultation sessions captured and reflected the concerns of women to inform the resettlement process. The Project will continuously engage and consult with various categories of stakeholders, including women, throughout the Project cycle by the implementation of a Stakeholder Engagement Plan and CESMS. KTZ will also revise its HR policies and procedures to better address and define gender-based violence and sexual harassment to include disciplinary measures and definitions of prohibited behaviors.Occupational & Community Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions. KTZ has an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) management system in place certified to the ISO45001 standard, and a corporate Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) that covers its core operations. Construction OHS risks are managed through a contractor OHS management plan. KTZ and the EPC contractor will appoint additional OHS managers and personnel for implementation and oversight of the OHS management plan. KTZ’s (HR) policies align with national legislation and are generally consistent with International Standards. The HR Policy and Human Rights Policy cover working conditions, freedom of association, non-discrimination, occupational health and safety, internal grievance mechanisms, and third-party supplier labor standards. In addition, due to the project's proximity to settlements and villages, particularly at Kazybek Bek and Zhetygen stations, community health and safety risks may arise during both the construction and operational phases. KTZs systems for managing operational rail safety will be checked for compliance with good international industry practice (GIIP) and updated if required prior to operations commencing. Overpasses are designed into the Project to minimize risks associated with crossing the railway and the completeness of this provision is committed to be reviewed for assurance prior to operations commencing.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure. The stakeholder engagement activities as part of the SESIA studies (gender-sensitive), included interviews with government officials; focus group discussions with farmers, representatives of small businesses and vulnerable groups; a socio-economic baseline survey conducted with 298 respondents among the Project-affected people between October 28, 2024, and January 26, 2025. The four District Akimats of Talgar, Iliy, Karasay and Zhambyl were engaged extensively throughout these consultations. SEP was developed within the scope of SESIA, which will be disclosed together with the NTS, SESIA, BMP, and LRP 60 days before project approval. The SEP identifies general public, individual and community and project level information disclosure, communication and consultation strategies for the construction and operation phases of the Project.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). A three levels of grievance resolution will be established at the site level for small matters that may be raised to the Community Liaison Level, and the Grievance Redress Committees (GRC) at district level and the GRC at the Project and Headquarter level. In addition, the KTZ website presents several ways for communicating grievances including a hotline phone number, mobile application, and third-party provider’swebsitethat contain a complaint form. The Ombudsman of NC KTZ JSC is also reachable for any complaint or resolution of community conflicts throughombudsman@railways.kz. The information of project-level GRM and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed to local communities in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.KTZ will monitor the key ES parameters and performance indicators during construction as identified in the CESMS framework and associated management plans. An ES monitoring plan for the operations phase will be developed within the scope of corporate ESMS update that will cover relevant parameters and indicators, consistent with operations phase ES management plans. KTZ will submit annual reports to AIIB and IFC in the agreed format for review. The Bank’s ES Specialists will conduct semi-annual missions to monitor the implementation of the ES instruments and assess the Borrower’s ES performance, with the frequency of missions to be adjusted based on performance and associated risks.",USD150 million,Category A,OK

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been categorized as Category B with high-risk rating, considering the significant environmental and social (ES) impacts on marine and terrestrial biodiversity due to brine discharge to the marine environment and aqueduct passing through biosphere reserve, and potential occupational health and safety issues due to civil construction activities including a 6 km tunnel development.Environmental and Social Instruments.The Fund Manager (Patria) has established an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) aligned with AIIB ESP for ES risk management and has also adopted the AIIB’s ESEL for screening of potential investment. For this co-investment in seawater desalination project, an independent E&S consultant was hired by the Fund Manager to conduct ES Due diligence (ESDD) and identify the gaps with respect to the IFC Performance Standards (PSs) and also assessed the project according to Equator Principles (EP), national legislation and international best practices. ESDD identified the gaps, assessed risks and prepared an ES Action Plan (ESAP) which is being implemented by Aguas Pacifico (Client). As part of Patria's managed Infra V Fund, the Project is closely monitored by Patria's Management and Transformation ESG team.Environment and Social Aspects.The environmental impacts identified by ESDD include noise, air quality, waste management, and safety risks which are associated with construction activities. During the operational phase, the primary anticipated impact of the desalination plant is on the marine environment due to brine discharge. To mitigate this impact, the client plans to store and treat the salty seawater after the desalination process before discharging it into the sea. Additionally, the brine discharge points will be between 650 and 720 meters offshore, which is expected to minimize negative effects on marine water quality. The management plan also includes environmental monitoring of program to study marine water quality together with local fishermen and local stakeholders, during both the construction and operational phases. The pipeline passes through forest areas and the buffer zone of a biosphere reserve. The necessary environmental licenses and forest permits have been obtained for the pipeline installation. Additionally, the ESDD identified potential environmental and community impacts of the tunnel construction and recommended necessary measures, including a Water Supply Contingency Plan (WSCP) and an Infiltration and Seepage Management Plan (ISMP). These plans aim to mitigate ES risks such as disruptions to community water supply caused by tunnel construction and the potential contamination of nearby water resources from untreated water discharge originating from the tunnel. The ES team of the Fund Manager are closely monitoring Aguas Pacifico’s compliance with approval and permit conditions.Social and Gender Aspects.ESDD concludes that the pipeline installation in this Project is not causing any physical displacement but, in some areas, it temporarily causes economic displacement on some stakeholders, that are treated and compensated in alignment with the relevant mechanism. Project-affected people (PAPs) have been economically compensated by Aguas Pacifico for these temporary losses. In addition, Aguas Pacifico engages with local men and women and it is evolving to more structured gender-inclusive strategies. AIIB encourages and will monitor efforts to promote gender diversity and equity through community-based initiatives.Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) and Labor Working Conditions: The ESDD identified the gaps with respect to OHS policy and procedures and recommends development of the Health and Safety Management Plan (“HSMP”). Aguas Pacifico has identified critical risks and implemented procedures to control the safety risks. Aguas Pacifico has a health and safety team to address the safety requirements of the Project. OHS indicators have been developed to continuously monitor the OHS performance of the Project. Safety trainings are also provided to the workers at the project site. Additionally, Aguas Pacifico’s Human Resources, Human Rights and Contractor Management Plans include specific measures to ensure compliance with IFC PS 2 requirements on Labor and Working Conditions, equally covered in AIIB’s ESS1. The plan requires all worker accommodations comply with the requirements in the IFC’s good practice guidance. Aguas Pacifico will ensure future accessibility and transparency of the Worker Grievance Mechanism (WGM) through induction trainings, posters, and designated team members to manage and resolve complaints, allowing for anonymous submissions.Stakeholder Engagement, Information Disclosure and Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM).Fund Manager has ensured stakeholder engagement by Aguas Pacifico and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) includes a stakeholder map that identifies all stakeholders in the project area of influence, and with whom Aguas Pacifico have engaged prior to the start of construction works. Aguas Pacifico conducted stakeholder meetings in the project area and informed stakeholders about project activities and impacts before soliciting their comments and concerns. The Fund’s Responsible Investment Policy (RIP) has been publicly disclosed on its website (link). ES information1,2,3about the project is already available in public domain. To ensure addressal of grievances from project stakeholder, Aguas Pacifico has also developed stakeholder-based GRM4. The information of established GRM and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring & Reporting: As part of Patria's managed Infra V Fund, the Project is closely monitored by Patria's Management and Transformation ESG team. Fund Manager will provide a periodic update to AIIB on ESAP implementation based on agreed format. AIIB’s ES specialists will visit the investee’s activities and to receive relevant information on the investee and its activities.

The Project will be governed by different ES policies. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will apply to the AIIB parallel financed Subcomponent 2.1 and to the joint co-financed Component 3.4 in which AIIB is the lead financing agency. The ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) of AIIB’s ESP are the applicable ESSs as construction activities will cause environmental risks land acquisition and resettlement of local people. The Project is not situated in the areas where ethnic minorities are present; therefore, the policies relating to ethnic minority/indigenous peoples of the co-financiers are not triggered. The Project has adopted a common approach on alignment of the application of the environmental and social (ES) policies of AIIB, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and Green Climate Fund (GCF). Agreements among development partners emphasize a client-first approach, reducing complexity for the government while upholding ES requirements and standards of the financiers.ES Categorization and Instruments.The Project is proposed to be Category B, as it has a limited number of potentially adverse ES impacts that are not unprecedented, few of which are irreversible or cumulative, and all of which can be successfully managed using good operational practices. The Project will focus solely on upgrading, rehabilitating, and modernizing existing irrigation infrastructure to enhance water productivity; therefore, ES risks and impacts by the Project are not significant. The alignment of the application of the ES policies of AIIB, IFAD, and GCF is applied to the Project’s ES instruments. Framework instruments were developed, i.e., the Environmental, Social and Climate Management Planning Framework (ESCMPF), Land Acquisition and Resettlement Planning Framework (LARPF), and Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF). The draft Environmental, Social, and Climate Impact Assessment (ESCIA), including the Environmental, Social, and Climate Management Plans (ESCMPs) for irrigation subprojects and a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) have been prepared and are being finalized by the PMU.Environmental Aspect.The Project is expected to have negative environmental impacts during construction which include air emissions; noise generation; contamination of surface water, soil environment and groundwater; impacts to flora and fauna; spoil disposal and use of borrow sites; soil erosion; solid waste generation; wastewater discharge; and other unanticipated impacts. During operations, potential risks and impacts may include, but not limited to local ecohydrology, on patterns of flow in terms of water volume and water quality, particularly changes in sediments and/or contamination by pollutants; degradation of soils (physical and chemical such as soil erosion, waterlogging and salinization); nutrient management; use and management of pesticides and fertilizers; crop residue and solid waste management; and impacts on long-term sustainability of the water management system in terms of potential water use conflicts, and unsustainable irrigation practices. Further on biodiversity, there are no internationally recognized areas (Key Biodiversity Areas, Ramsar Sites, World Heritage) and no legally protected areas within 10km of all subprojects, however, further mitigation measures are in place in the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) within the ESCIA. All potential impacts are manageable with the implementation of ES instruments and the good international industry practices, standards, procedures, guidelines, and design criteria.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project implementation would require land acquisition from local households; however, the scope of land acquisition by the Project is insignificant. The conducted ESCIA for the Project shows that a total of 71 households would have their lands acquired by the Project; of which, 63 households would be partially affected, and eight (8) households would be fully affected (physically displaced). Land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out following the relevant laws and regulations of the Government and the requirement of agreed LARPF for the Project. Voluntary land donation is proposed for the minor land acquisition impact for upgrading and rehabilitation of tertiary and quarter canals. The eligible criteria for voluntary donation, the procedure of implementing donation, the Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and monitoring arrangements (internal and external) for planning and implementation of voluntary donation have been reflected in the approved LARPF of the Project. In addition, The Project would bring various benefits to local women, especially for improvements of their skills and business, livelihoods, and community participation. Furthermore, the Project will address gender inequality for those who are affected by climate change vulnerability such as floods and droughts. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) has been developed with various measures to be implemented to provide project’s benefits as well as to manage the potential negative risks and impacts of the Project to local women.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions.During construction phase, there is a risk of injuries or fatalities among workers or members of the public from Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). Other potential OHS risks and impacts include collision with moving machinery and vehicle, prolonged exposure to dust and exceeding levels of noise and vibration, working at heights, risk of fall and drowning, electrical safety, and issues in worker camps. During operations phase, poor and inadequate operations and maintenance of irrigation schemes could cause impacts. Other potential risks and impacts are, but are not limited to, falls and drowning into the canals, especially for vulnerable groups such as children, and infrastructure safety such as unauthorized access to offtake structures. Further potential OHS risks and impacts include physical hazards such as working at height, falls, drowning, and chemical hazards from exposure to pesticide/chemical fertilizers), among others. The ESCMP outlines the corresponding mitigation measures.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure. The Project implementing agency has conducted three rounds of consultations with the main stakeholders in different stages of project preparation. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared and consulted with the stakeholders. The SEP will be implemented and monitored to ensure the achievement of the objectives mentioned. The prepared ES instruments (ESCPF, LARPF, IPPF, draft ESCIA, draft ESCMPs) and SEP have been disclosed on the website of MoWRAM in December 2024. Summaries of the documents in Khmer language have been disclosed in the easily accessible public places of the project communities in January 2025. The ES instruments of the Project have also been posted on AIIB’ website in January 2025. The finalized ESCIA and ESCMPs, once available, will also be disclosed in the same manner.ProjectGrievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). A Project-level GRM has been proposed in consultations with the stakeholders and included in the ES instruments as well as the SEP. Summaries of the ES instruments and SEP with the GRM in Khmer language were placed in the easily accessible public places of the project communities in January 2025. The documents with the GRM included have been disclosed on the websites of MoWRAM and AIIB. The procedure for grievance redressal is culturally appropriate and gender sensitive. The project-level GRM will be established and functional once the Project is approved by the financiers and the Government.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.MoWRAM will be responsible for the overall coordination of Project monitoring. The Project Management and Implementation Consultants (PMICs) will be recruited to support the PMU in establishing or confirming baselines, monitoring the implementation process, checking the progress of the Project's results indicators, and assessing achievements towards the Project’s objectives. MoWRAM will prepare consolidated reports for the co-financiers based on agreed format. AIIB, IFAD and GCF will jointly monitor the status of the Project implementation and result indicators through biannual implementation support missions. As the lead co-financier, AIIB will proactively plan and coordinate with other partners on mission timing, objectives, and the key skills required for joint missions with IFAD and GCF, ensuring sufficient resources are allocated to the missions and reviews.",USD100 million,Category A,OK

Additionally, a certain percentage will be directed towards loans for acquisition or construction of green affordable housing.","Applicable Policy and Categorization:AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) is applicable to this Project. The Project is expected to have minimal adverse environmental and social (ES) impacts as the loan proceeds will be used for (i) lending to individual borrowers for the construction and acquisition of residential property units or (ii) to private residential property developers for financing the construction of small-scale residential developments (one to few apartment blocks) in line with the housing construction regulations in India. Therefore, the Project is placed in Category FI and is expected to have limited adverse ES impacts which are reversible and can be successfully managed using known good practices.Environment and Social Instruments:To manage ES impacts and in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of the Government of India and AIIB’s ESP, IIFLHF has established an ESG Policy and Sustainable Finance Framework (SFF) in addition to a set of internal policies, including Health and Safety Policy, Diversity and Inclusion Policy, among others. IIFLHF has also established a Fair Practices Code (FPC) to ensure responsible lending conduct and disclosures. These policies are complemented with practical tools such asKutumb.Environmental and Social Aspects:The main environmental aspects related to provision of loans to homeowners for purchase of green and/or affordable homes are related to occupational health and safety of using home appliances and use of building services. For loans related to builders for housing development, environmental aspects are extended to health and safety at construction and operation of the buildings, waste management, and resource efficiency during construction and operation. Land shall be acquired following market principles and awilling seller, willing buyermodel. The Project will exclude sub-projects that involve properties built on land with legacy issues and disputes, land resulting from unlawful forced evictions, having adverse impacts on indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups, negative impacts on essential cultural heritage, significant degradation or conversion of critical habitats, and illegal construction that does not comply with applicable national and local laws and regulations. The ES risks and impacts are therefore expected to be limited to labor and working conditions, occupational health and safety aspects of using domestic home appliances and building services. AIIB will conduct prior review and approval of the first three sub-loans to corporate developers and all high-risk sub-loans.Gender aspects:IIFLHF has adopted gender sensitive and inclusive corporate policies which are applied internally. IIFLHF has also established a policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment and an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in accordance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. IIFLHF has adopted several gender sensitive initiatives such as gender inclusion indicators, and prioritization of loans disbursed to women homeowners/ co-owners.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.ES policies applied by IIFLHF as part of their ESG policy and SFF incorporate provisions for application of national Health & Safety and Labor and employment legislation across all the investments supported. Most project’s proceeds (in terms of number of sub-loans) will be used for acquisition of affordable housing dwelling by individual homeowners of disadvantaged social groups. Health and safety risks for that use of proceeds are of limited scale and limited to health and safety considerations of using domestic home appliances and building services. These projects, undertaken by private developers are typically of limited size with minimal adverse impacts, with most of financing is sought at advanced stage of development process when all the ES risks are already fully addressed.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.IIFLHF has a strong stakeholder matrix and engagement plan. The identified stakeholders include (i)the customers, including women, from EWS and LIG category;(ii)civil societies / NGOs(iii)media;(iv)vendors and contractors; and(v)Regulators / Government.TheESG policy,SFFand otherpolicy documents1are available on IIFLHF’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM):IIFLHF has a well-established multi-pronged GRM that can be accessed via its website, physical branches, helpline number and dedicated call center. IIFLHF will require its corporate sub-borrowers to establish appropriate GRM at the sub-project level. Provision will also be made to inform Project-affected Persons (PAPs) and workers of the GRM’s availability, and AIIB's Project-Affected Peoples' Mechanism (PPM).Monitoring and reporting arrangement:IIFLHF will regularly monitor ES performance of financed projects using agreed checklists and provide ES reports on the AIIB-financed portfolio annually based on agreed format. AIIB will supervise IIFLHF’s ES performance on a regular basis, including site visits to selected affordable housing sub-projects, as needed.",,FI,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable to the ES aspects of the Project. The Project includes development of wind turbines, battery energy storage system (BESS) and 220 kV overhead transmission line (OHTL), Category B is assigned as the Project will have a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (ES) impacts during construction and operation phases. Asian Development Bank (ADB) is considering participating in the financing as a senior lender (project finance) and they have categorized as B for environment and B for involuntary resettlement.Environmental and Social Instruments:The Client has prepared an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), Non-Technical Summary of the ESIA (NTS), stakeholder engagement plan (SEP) and is currently finalizing the Land Acquisition and Livelihood Restoration Plan (LALRP). Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) for the Project has been carried out and biodiversity management measures have been prepared. Lenders’ Environmental and Social Advisor (LESA) hired by the Project carried out ES due diligence (ESDD) and reviewed the project ES documents as well as the Client’s ES management capacity. The ESDD report and Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) have been prepared for the Project.Environmental Aspects:The environmental impacts linked with the construction phase include increased dust levels, gaseous emissions, noise and vibration, generation of solid waste and hazardous waste, wastewater, soil contamination, traffic impacts and occupational health and safety impacts. A construction phase environmental and social management plan (CESMP) will be prepared before the start of construction activities. The environmental impacts during the operational phase of the wind project include bird and bat collision-related fatalities, noise, electrocution of birds within the overhead transmission line footprint, generation of waste, and spills and leaks during maintenance activities. The mitigations measures are included in the ESIA and detailed plans to manage operational phase impacts will also be prepared as part of the operational phase ESMP. In addition, CHA concluded that critical habitat (CH) is triggered for Bukhara Red Deer and Common Crane. The Lower Amu Darya State Biosphere Reserve (LADSBR) is known to hold the largest remaining concentration of these endangered subspecies. The Common Crane was not observed during the spring, 2024 vantage point (VP) surveys conducted along the Project’s OHTL route. However, notable sightings of these species were recorded at the Nukus I wind farm. Therefore, a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) will be developed prior to the start of construction activities for biodiversity values for which CH was identified. During the assessment 36 species were identified as Priority Biodiversity Features (PBFs) and the detailed biodiversity management measures are included in the ESIA.Social and Gender Aspects:The entire land in Uzbekistan as per the country law belongs to the government. The Wind Farm (WF) and the OHTL will require land acquisition of around 103 Ha. According to the census conducted in 2024, the Wind farm and OHTL will impact a total of 39 households, of which 6 will be impacted by the WF and 33 by the OHTL, but the Project will not cause any physical displacement. The Project will result in the impact of two commercial and 7 residential plots. ESIA assessed loss of wages by the agriculture farm workers. The number of workers on the impacted agricultural farms varies depending on the season, such as during harvesting or planting periods. However, the livelihoods of engaged workers are not expected to be impacted, as the impacts on those lands are anticipated to be low. In addition, a total of 25 households have been categorized as vulnerable as per the definition agreed for vulnerable households. As part of the LALRP, a comprehensive Livelihood Restoration Program (LRP) has been developed. Under this program, affected households, severely impacted project-affected-people (PAPs), and vulnerable groups including women, youth, and persons with disabilities will be eligible for livelihood restoration support in addition to the compensation they receive. The ESIA study identified several potential impacts of the Project that may disproportionately affect women and has proposed mitigation measures to address those impacts. These mitigation measures, along with other actions to address gender-related risks, will be detailed in the Gender Action Plan (GAP) and incorporated into other ESMPs.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions:The Project will involve OHS risks typically associated with construction activities. These include collisions with moving machinery and vehicles, hazards related to the use of explosives and hazardous chemicals, risks of electric shock, mechanical and load-handling accidents, exposure to noise, dust, and chemical vapors. To address these risks, mitigation measures have been outlined in the ESMP. Additionally, the SPV, EPC contractor and O&M contractor will be required to prepare and implement a comprehensive Labor and Working Conditions Management Plan (LWCMP). This plan will ensure non-discrimination and equal opportunities in employment, Gender Based Violence and Harassment (GBVH) risk management, provisions for managing migrant labor safety protocols are in place to protect workers and minimize risks during construction and operational phases. The plan will also include training, monitoring, and emergency response measures to promote a safe and healthy working environment.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure:As part of the scoping phase and the preparation of the ESIA and the LALRP, a SEP was developed. This plan includes a detailed mapping of relevant primary and secondary stakeholders, such as individuals, groups, and institutions impacted by or interested in the Project. Additionally, a final consultation with affected households will be conducted with the specific objective of disclosing and gathering feedback on the LALRP entitlement matrix to ensure it adequately addresses community needs and concerns. The SEP will need to be updated to address stakeholder engagement requirements during the construction and operational phases of the Project. ES instruments prepared in both English and summaries in the local language, including draft ESIA, ESMP, LALRP and NTS were disclosed in-country via ACWA Power and also on AIIB’s website, hard copies of the documents in local language will be made available at the project site for local communities and stakeholders, ensuring ease of access and informed participation in the process.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A GRM has been established that includes key principles, scope and detailed procedures along with a process flow and timeline for addressing grievances promptly. The GRM also allows for anonymous grievances to be processed and facilitates the PAPs to submit their grievances arising from the land and other asset compensation or any other issues in relation to the Project.

The MPP aligns with the Phase 1 of the National Highway Authority (NHA) of Pakistan’s 20-year, four-phase plan to rebuild and expand this critical national infrastructure.Within this broader MPP framework, the Phase 1A Project (the “Project”) focuses on three key sections of N-5, covering a total of 141 km: Ranipur to Sukkur (70 km) in Sindh Province, Rawalpindi to Burhan (40 km) in Punjab Province and the Islamabad Capital Territory, and Nowshera to Peshawar (31 km) in KP Province. The Phase 1B project will focus on another key section of N-5: Lahore to Gujranwala (68 km) in Punjab province, alongside the reconstruction of the Nai Baran Bridge in Sindh Province. The Phase 1B project will be prepared and approved later than the Phase 1A Project after meeting certain criteria.The Phase 1A Project consists of three components:Civil Works to reconstruct the three critical sections of N-5.Consultancy Support and Capacity Building, including the hiring of a Design Review and Construction Supervision Consultancy, an Independent Environmental and Social Monitoring Consultancy, and the Project Management Unit capacity building.Baseline Cost and Improvements, such as Resettlement and Relocation cost, shifting of utilities, etc.The AIIB has mobilized a USD2 million Project Preparation Special Fund (PPSF) grant to strengthen the preparation of the Project and the MPP by enhancing climate mitigation and resilience, safety, ES assessments, and digital project management capabilities.This Project represents the Bank’s first standalone project in Pakistan’s transport sector.","Applicable Policy and Categorization: AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), applies to both the MPP and the Phase 1A Project. The Project triggers ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement). ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable, as no indigenous peoples are present or have a collective attachment to the Project area. The Project is classified as Environmental and Social (ES) Category A, reflecting significant ES risks due to large-scale resettlement and relocation (R&R) and construction activities, including the widening and upgrading of an existing highway from four lanes to six lanes. These activities span a large geographic area, with the potential to generate substantial ES impacts.Environmental and Social Instruments: The Project adopts a Multi-phase Program (MPP) approach, where only the first three priority N-5 sections have undergone detailed engineering design prior to Project Appraisal. As a result, both a framework approach and site-specific ES assessments are necessary. These instruments include: (a) Framework-level instruments: Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF), Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF), Labor Management Plan (LMP), Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) Gender Action Planning Framework (GAPF), and Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), covering both Phase 1A and Phase 1B; and (b) Site-specific instruments for Phase 1A: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).Environment Aspects:The MPP and Project scope involves the widening and upgrading of the existing highway from four lanes to six. Although many environmental risks and impacts are already present due to the highway’s current state, the proposed upgrades could introduce new impacts. Initial ES screening and reconnaissance site visits have identified several key environmental concerns, including sensitive receptors such as nearby forests and national parks, water bodies, traffic congestion, accidents, drainage issues, waterlogging, and the presence of trees and vegetation within the right-of-way (ROW) of N-5. Potential environmental risks identified include: (i) construction waste management; (ii) air and noise pollution due to dust, noise, and vibration; (iii) the risk of operational or accidental spills, particularly from fuel and lubricants used in construction machinery; (iv) biodiversity risks and damage to aquatic ecology, changes in hydrological conditions, obstruction of animal migration, and water pollution; and (v) improper site reinstatement, where construction sites are inadequately restored post-project. The ESMPF has addressed these risks with generic mitigation measures. A more detailed, site-specific assessment of these risks has also been carried out during the ESIA and ESMP processes for Phase 1A, with appropriate mitigation measures developed during the road planning and design phases to minimize potential impacts. In addition, a comprehensive noise assessment will be conducted, including additional measurements and noise modeling at various locations, particularly near noise-sensitive receptors.Social Aspects:The MPP and the Project are expected to generate positive social benefits for the local population, including enhanced climate resilience, improved travel conditions, better road safety, reduced transportation costs, shorter travel times, and alleviated congestion. However, there are potential social risks and impacts that need to be addressed. These include the potential lack of inclusion of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups to share the Project benefits, inadequate and ineffective stakeholder engagement, large-scale resettlement and relocation (R&R), restrictions on land use, and economic displacement caused by civil works. Additionally, risks are associated with labor and working conditions, including occupational health and safety (OHS), community health and safety related to potential labor influx. The livelihood impacts related to R&R primarily concern the economic displacement of informal businesses, such as shops and stalls, due to road widening, and impacts on religious and community structures. The extent and severity of these impacts have been evaluated and mitigated in the RAP. Furthermore, the potential impact of Project activities on women has been assessed in the gender assessment for the GAPF and ESIA. Measures to address the potential negative impacts, particularly from the migrant workers’ influx and the associated risks of gender-based violence (GBV)/Sexual Harassment (SH)/Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA), have been included in the ESMP and the GAPF, as well as in the Gender Action Plan (GAP) to be integrated into each site-specific RAP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions (LWC):The MPP and the Project will involve typical construction work-related OHS risks such as work-related accidents, hazards associated with the use of explosives and hazardous chemicals, electric shock, mechanical and load handling hazards, health issues from work environment, and traffic and road safety. Relevant mitigation measures have been formulated in the ESMP. Construction-specific risks and impacts considered under the MPP and the Project are further related to significant labor influx and potential social tensions with the host communities. The ESMP and the LMP prepared for the Project have included relevant procedures to manage LWC risks and impacts during both the construction and operational phases. The EMSP/LMP will be implemented, monitored, and reported to address these OHS/LWC risks and impacts.Stakeholder Consultation, and Information Disclosure: Preliminary consultations with key stakeholders, including relevant national and state departments and project-affected peoples (PAPs), have been carried out by the Client and their consultant as part of the site reconnaissance process. A SEP has been prepared to identify stakeholders and build and maintain a constructive relationship with them. Site-specific identification and analysis of stakeholders, and plans for the ongoing engagement throughout the Project cycle, has been included in the RAPs. The SEP has assessed stakeholders’ interests and support of the Project and taken their views and feedback into account in Project design and in the assessment of ES risks and impacts, this will continue through meaningful and inclusive consultations with potentially affected and interested stakeholders throughout the Project cycle.

With the arrangement involving the provision of funds through an FI, the Project has been placed in Category FI, whereby AIIB delegates to EBL the decision-making on the use of AIIB's funds in so far as the infrastructure sub-projects meet the conditions to be agreed upon with EBL. This includes the selection, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of sub-projects and oversight of the sub-borrowers and sub-projects in line with AIIB's ESP requirements. Coal mining, coal transportation, coal-fired power plants, and infrastructure services that inclusively support these activities and gas-related sub-projects or investments will be excluded.Environmental and Social Instruments.EBL has existing Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS), namely, the Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Procedure for their commercial bank operations and trade finance as part of theirCredit Instruction Manual. For the AIIB financing facility (the Project), EBL has agreed to prepare an addendum or a standalone ESMS (enhanced ESMS) to define the process for screening, categorization, appraisal, contracting and monitoring sub-loans supported by AIIB loan proceeds according to the ESP, and specifically the applicability of AIIB ESF for higher activities. EBL’s commitment to enhancing its ESMS has been incorporated into an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) agreed by EBL which will be part of the loan agreement. The enhanced ESMS for the Project will be submitted to AIIB for review and approval prior to the utilization of the AIIB’s proceeds and the overview of the enhanced ESMS will be disclosed. In addition, a technical assistance grant from the Multilateral Cooperation Center for Development Finance (MCDF) has been approved to support EBL in enhancing its ESMS. This grant will bolster EBL's capacity for infrastructure on-lending by aligning its ESMS with AIIB's ESP.Environmental and Social Aspects. The AIIB facility is expected to support sub-projects in multiple infrastructure sub-sectors, including energy, water, and digital infrastructure. The sub-projects' potential E&S risks and impacts will be mostly from the civil works/construction activities such as impact to sensitive environmental and social area, biodiversity, physical and economic displacement due to permanent or temporary land and/or right-of-way acquisition, health and safety, impacts from associated facilities and impacts on indigenous communities, among others. Prior review and consent of AIIB will be required for the first three sub-projects and all Category A sub-projects or other sub-projects that involve Higher Risk Activities before funds are allocated to these sub-projects. The categorization of the sub-projects will follow the principles set out in the enhanced ESMS for AIIB loan proceeds. The review and clearance process by EBL and AIIB and follow-up action needed will be a condition precedent to the use of AIIB’s proceeds.Gender Aspect.EBL's ESMS acknowledges broader and gender-related issues in the country and introduces effective mechanisms to screen, assess and mitigate any gender-related issues in sub-project due diligence and appraisal, including gender-based violence (GBV) during construction and operation of sub-projects. EBL's ESMS explicitly stipulates equal, inclusive and gender-supportive policies, with zero tolerance for any forms of gender, race, social, or other forms of discrimination. Gender-specific opportunities will also be identified during the construction and operation of sub-projects that contribute to the overall socioeconomic development. Moreover, screening, assessing, and mitigating gender-related risks and impacts at the sub-project level will be further mainstreamed in the enhanced EBL’s ESMS.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The sub-projects will conform with the OHS and labor laws and standards of Bangladesh and the enhanced and ESP-aligned ESMS. As agreed in the ESAP, for all solar power sub-projects, EBL will review the sub-borrowers' supply chain information and screen for any potential adverse labor and working conditions involving their suppliers. AIIB’s E&S team will closely monitor EBL's documentation of its due diligence for solar power sub-projects following the ESAP and the Project’s legal agreement terms.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.Stakeholder engagement in the Project will be guided by the stakeholder consultation and disclosure framework under EBL’s ESRM. EBL publishes Sustainability Reports, which provide information about the company's progress in ESG matters. To comply with the AIIB’s ESP, EBL will disclose the overview of enhanced ESMS applicable to AIIB’s financing. Additionally, sub-borrowers will disclose their E&S instruments for Category A at least 60 calendar days before the final approval of the activity. EBL will also continue to disclose its E&S performance on its website in a timely manner, as well as in its Annual Sustainability Report. Its stakeholder consultation and disclosure framework will be assessed as part of the ESMS enhancement review supported by the MCDF grant and will be assessed periodically during the implementation.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). EBL has a Complaint Management Cell (CMC) managed by a selected compliance team to receive complaints and related reports/issues, which will be used as the Project GRM. The enhanced ESMS will include the requirement of EBL’s sub-borrowers to establish a functional sub-project level GRM to receive, evaluate, and facilitate the resolution of the concerns and complaints relating to E&S. This will be undertaken using understandable and transparent processes that are gender-responsive, culturally appropriate, and readily accessible. The information of established GRMs and AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.EBL has a dedicated E&S Manager and Risk Management staff who conducts E&S risk monitoring visits and the results of these visits will be documented in monitoring reports. A similar mechanism will be incorporated into the enhanced ESMS for the EBL’s infrastructure sub-projects using AIIB’s loan proceeds, and EBL will be required, based on agreed format, to prepare an annual E&S performance report of its sub-projects for submission to AIIB.

The Project is classified as Category FI because it involves the provision of funds through a Financial Institution (FI). Under this financing arrangement, AIIB will delegate to Regional Development Bank of the Extreme South (BRDE) the decision-making authority regarding the allocation of AIIB's funds to sub-projects that meet the agreed-upon conditions. This includes the selection, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of sub-projects, as well as the oversight of sub-borrowers and sub-projects, in compliance with AIIB's ESP requirements.Environmental and Social Instruments:BRDE has an approved Social, Environmental, and Climate Responsibility Policy (link) which sets out principles and criteria to ensure that its investments align with best sustainability practices, and in addition, as a regional development bank in Brazil, BRDE has its own Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). AIIB will assess BRDE’s ESMS and make recommendations for enhancement as needed, referencing AIIB’s ESP, ESSs, and ESEL, particularly for higher risk sub-projects comprising all Category A and selected Category B sub-projects. In parallel with identifying opportunities to enhance BRDE’s ESMS, a Project Operational Manual (POM) will be prepared which will guide the selection, monitoring, and evaluation of sub-projects implemented by sub-borrowers, and include provisions to address gaps identified in BRDE’s ESMS.Environmental and Social Aspects:To ensure environmental and social (ES) compliance, due diligence will be conducted on the sub-projects on which BRDE intends to on-lend. Sub-projects may present various ES risks especially where infrastructure works are involved. Such risks may relate to health and safety, noise and dust generation, pollution due to improper waste management, biodiversity impacts and losses due to rehabilitation and modernization of transport and other energy infrastructure. BRDE will be required to confirm that sub-projects do not involve significant land acquisition or take place on Indigenous Peoples' lands. In addition, based on ES Due Diligence (ESDD) process, an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) will be prepared with BRDE to address any outstanding issues within a defined timeframe. As part of the ESDD, the Bank will also assess the processes for gender-related consultations to identify any perceived gender-based violence (GBV) risk or gender inequality in the sub-projects. Adverse ES risks will be managed and mitigated through BRDE’s ESMS and the ESAP. BRDE has prior experience with other MDBs and relies on internal full-time staff to implement the ESMS. AIIB will assess BRDE’s technical capacity and identify areas for training and capacity building to effectively implement the ESMS.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions:As part of its ESMS, BRDE will screen all sub-projects for potential labor and working conditions issues. The ESMS will also incorporate requirements to identify and mitigate health, safety, social, and environmental risks associated with sub-project activities that may impact employees and disrupt site operations.

The proposed total debt financing for the Project is USD144 million which would primarily be used to fund the construction of the solar plant and other costs such as financing costs, contingency etc.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List, Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management), and ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) shall apply to the Project. Since there are no indigenous community in the project area, ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. The Project has been classified as Category B since: (i) it has a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (E&S) impacts; (ii) the impacts are not unprecedented; few if any of them are irreversible or cumulative; they are limited to the project area; and (iii) since the borrower has inhouse capacity to manage the E&S risks, that can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting.Environmental and Social Instruments.The Project through an independent consultant has conducted an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and based on the findings of the ESIA, an Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management Plan (ESMP) has been prepared that complies with country E&S requirements, AIIB ESP and aligns with good international industry practices (GIIP). A Livelihood Restoration Framework (LRF) has been developed to mitigate adverse economic impacts largely due to 12.8 km of transmission line. A detailed Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) will be prepared during the implementation stage based on training need assessment of the landowners.Environmental Aspects.The potential environmental impacts include impacts on the surface water bodies in immediate vicinity of the proposed site, changes in natural water drainage patterns can occur due to land levelling and infrastructure possibly affecting local hydrology, conversion of natural habitats or agricultural land can disrupt local ecosystems and wildlife habitats potentially leading to loss of biodiversity, soil compaction and erosion can occur during construction impacting soil health and water retention capacity resulting in increased pressure on the available water resources in the study region and the solar project park may act as a physical barrier for animals, disrupting their natural movement and feeding patterns. The ESIA study confirms the presence of approximately 100 to 120 trees within the study area, however most of these would be retained during the layout planning process as confirmed by the Borrower (SAEL Solar MHP1 Private Limited). There are also two non-perennial nala present within the site connecting the Penna River at approximately 1.8 km aerial distance from the site. No impacts are envisaged on the drainage as adequate buffer distance to natural drainage channels would be proposed as mitigation measures in the ESMP. To understand the likelihood of critical habitat for the Project, a Critical Habitat Screening was conducted using IBAT tool to identify threatened species likely to occur within or nearby the project area. The ESIA report provides interim details on the transmission line impacts which shall be updated by the consultant when the alignment and other technical details are finalized.Social Aspects.The Project will take 1,500 acres of private dry agriculture land on 29 years of long-term lease out of 1,881.32 acres identified for the Project. The Project has ensured that there is no physical displacement and no loss of and/or loss of access to public and private property. The ESIA evaluated the process of land lease to ensure that land taking process was fair and there are no legacy issues with the land. The ESIA also established that land leasing process has not resulted in physical displacement. The discussion with the landowners confirmed that majority of them have land outside of the leased land with irrigation facility. The transmission line will not lead to any physical displacement though there will be economic losses in terms of crop damages. During the construction phase of the project, nearly 200 construction workers will be employed at the project site. A Workers Management Plan (WMP) prepared by the Project will ensure that issues related to SEA/SH if any, are addressed properly. SAEL Industries at the corporate level has established the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and the same will be applicable on the Project. The established ESMS has provisions and framework to ensure the labor rights and welfare covering both on-roll employees and contractual workers.Gender Aspects.The Project conducted gender analysis as part of the ESIA and based on that a Gender Action Plan (GAP) that aims to promote gender equality and address gender specific challenges has been prepared. It ensures that gender perspectives are integrated into all aspects of planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of projects to empower women, improve their access to opportunities, and reduce gender-based disparities. SAEL Industries had formulated the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment to create and maintain safe working environment for women at workplace. The policy mentions about the procedure for raising complaints, manner of inquiry, confidentiality etc. Two gender related indicators that will be monitored during the course of the Project include: (i) percentage of women and men employed and trained in project related roles; and (ii) changes in gender-based decision making power in the local communities.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The Project as part of the ESIA assessed health and safety risks to project workers and Project-affected communities, and measures have been put in place to prevent accidents, injuries and disease (including as appropriate, measures in line with internationally recognized standards to avoid or minimize exposure to communicable and noncommunicable diseases, including pandemics) associated with the Project.  Given that the Project involves a large scale construction, a WMP has been prepared as part of the ESIA. There are potential impacts and risks associated with supply chains in relation to labor and working conditions. SAEL Industries has mentioned to have an ESMS in line with IFC Performance Standards and World Bank EHS Guidelines. The Sponsor has shared copies of its Contract Management and Supply Chain Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, and E&S clauses to be provided in contract agreements (covering special clauses, and health and safety and labor clauses).Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.The Project has identified stakeholders and consultation with the stakeholders were carried out to disseminate project information and to take their feedback on the project design, land procurement process, project’s resource requirement, project’s proposed activities, and social and environmental management plan. The feedback from the stakeholders have been incorporated in the design of the Project. To ensure continuous engagement with the stakeholders, the Project has developed SEP as part of ESMP that details out method of engagement, stages of engagement and purpose of engagement. The E&S instruments in English and summary in local language (Telugu) will be disclosed by SAEL Industries on its website and hard copies to be kept in the project area. This documentation will also be disclosed on AIIB’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.The Project will establish a multi-tier, gender responsive, culturally appropriate grievance redress mechanism (GRM) that will be accessible to the project affected individuals and communities free of cost. The Project will maintain the logbook of grievances received either in writing or verbal and also those recorded in the grievance register placed at the project site. The information of established GRM and AIIB’s Project Affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner. The status of grievances will be recorded and updated every week.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.Monitoring will be the responsibility of the Borrower and SAEL Industries supported by a qualified independent environmental and social advisory firm. The monitoring reports will be prepared semi-annually based on agreed formats and be provided to AIIB for review. The Bank will retain rights to conduct field supervision and monitoring visits during project implementation.",,Category B,OK

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been categorized as Category A, considering the significance of brine discharge to the marine environment from the operation of the desalination plants.Environmental and Social Instruments.An independent environmental and social (ES) consultant was hired by the Saudi Water Authority (SWA) to review its existing Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) against the requirements of AIIB’s ESP. As part of the ES due diligence (ESDD), the consultant also identified the associated facilities including water tanks and transmission lines, reviewed the domestic Environmental Impacts Assessment (EIA) reports of the desalination plants, and carried out desktop review and field inspection on the preparation and implementation of ES management plans during construction, commissioning or operation phases. Based on the ESDD findings as presented in the “Gap Assessment Report”, actions are proposed in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) to strengthen the ESMS and ES management at the desalination plants to align with AIIB’s ESP.Environmental Aspects.Given the construction of the two desalination plants and the associated facilities has been completed, the potential adverse environmental impacts are associated with plants commissioning and operation, which mainly include impacts to marine environment from brine discharge, treatment of domestic wastewater, disposal of solid waste, noise from pumps and other heavy machines, accidental oil spills, and energy consumption. The ESDD did not identify any environmental legacy issues from the construction phase. The key gaps are related to improving the procedures on the management of solid waste, wastewater, chemical storage and spill prevention, resource efficiency, and cascaded implementation of the ESMS at the plant and contractor level, for which actions were formulated in the ESAP. Moreover, the ESAP includes an action to develop and implement environmental monitoring plans for the two plants, covering monitoring of operation and maintenance (O&M) phase environmental impacts.Social Aspects.The Project is expected to generate positive impacts to local communities with better services and continuous clean water supply to meet the demand of the growing population. No impacts have been reported for land acquisition, involuntary (physical or economic) displacement, or heightened economic vulnerability. The ESDD did not identify any social legacy issues from the pre-and construction phases. Since the construction of the two desalination plants and the associated facilities has been completed as stated above, the potential social risks are only associated with the commissioning and operation of the plants. These impacts include labor and working conditions and health and safety risks for the nearby communities.Gender Aspects.SWA is committed to fostering human resources in the Kingdom, emphasizing the crucial role of women in the nation's resilience, aligned with Vision 2030 goals. SWA has certain gender-specific policies including women’s socioeconomic empowerment by increasing the number of female employees and female leadership, and for the prevention of gender-based violence (GBV). As per ESAP, SWA will include and implement gender-related actions through the strengthened ESMS.Occupational Health and Safety and Labor and Working Conditions.The ESDD reviewed the occupational health and safety (OHS) policy and procedures of SWA and the civil contractors, and the institutional arrangement for implementation, which is overall in compliance with AIIB’s ESP. No severe or serious OHS incident was reported during the construction phase. The ESDD identified gap-filling measures to be included in the ESMS and implemented during the Project implementation. The ESAP addresses these gaps and sets out the material measures and actions required for the Project to meet the ES requirements over a specified timeframe.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure. SWA conducted meetings in the Project area before initiating the construction activities, to inform the stakeholders about the Project activities and to solicit their comments and concerns. Going forward, SWA’s ESMS will be strengthened through the structured procedure to conduct stakeholder consultations during the commissioning and operation of the plants, therefore the ESAP includes an action to prepare and implement Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEP) for the two RO plants. The SEP will include the stakeholder identification and analysis of the Project and propose stakeholder engagement methods and program. In addition, SWA and AIIB have disclosed on their website the summary of the Gap Assessment Report and the ESAP.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).SWA has a whistleblowing department governed by the whistleblowing policy. Whistleblowing applies to all SWA staff and contractors. The department offers various uptake channels such as external and internal websites, hotline, email, and walk-ins. Grievances can be submitted anonymously. The GRM has the option of submitting anonymous or non-anonymous complaints. During the construction phase at the two RO plant sites, contractors maintained the site-specific grievance mechanisms. Contractors displayed a contact person and dedicated phone number on a noticeboard to lodge complaints. As per ESAP, the SWA will establish and disclose a corporate GRM in the two RO plants, including disclosing the information of AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM). SWA will provide regular reports on the GRM functioning with statistics.Monitoring Arrangements.The Client will submit ES monitoring reports based on the agreed format semi-annually during the first two years of operation and annually afterward to ensure the Project’s compliance with the ESAP and AIIB’s ESP.

Supports project management and other measures to improve implementation of the URP.","AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs), is applicable to the Project. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been classified as Category A, due primarily to the scale and complexity of the involuntary resettlement involved. The environmental impacts and risks are typical of urban construction projects of this kind (large-scale housing schemes) as are the health and safety issues. These are expected to be temporary, manageable through adequate mitigation measures, and not irreversible. The social risks and impacts associated with the proposed Project are complex and are mainly related to: (i) the determination of land ownership in the areas to be acquired for sub-projects under Components 1 and 2; (ii) the need to ensure that people’s livelihoods are not adversely affected by the move to the new sites; (iii) ensuring people will adapt to life in high-rise apartment blocks and safeguarding the long-term viability of the housing complexes and services; and (iv) the need to identify and engage with the affected households and other stakeholders, including people living near the new housing schemes, from the beginning of the Project (especially the need to facilitate the active participation of women, young people and people of different ethnic and socio-economic groups). These issues will be addressed through the post-resettlement and other social programs (currently implemented by the UDA) and will be further enhanced under Component 3.In accordance with the Bank’s ESP and national policy requirements, the Borrower and the UDA have prepared a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) that set out the general principles for managing the social and environmental impacts, especially the resettlement and post-resettlement measures needed to ensure that the standards of living and livelihoods of the households that are relocated can be enhanced or, at the very least, restored. The draft RPF and ESMPF were disclosed in English, Sinhala and Tamil versions on the websites of theUDA, MMWD andAIIB.Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) will be prepared for each of the sub-projects under Component 1, including the two or three sub-projects to be identified for the 1,400 new units for families that have yet to be identified, and will have to be reviewed and approved by the Bank and disclosed by the Bank and UDA during project implementation The ESMPs must be approved by the Bank and disclosed before the construction contracts are signed. The sub-projects under Component 2 will be covered by the RAPs for Component 1, since the Component 2 sites have either been or are being vacated under the current URP program or will be vacated when the families from these sites move to the housing units constructed under Component 1. The RAPs will focus on the site-specific issues related to each resettlement project. It should be noted that most of the resettlement sites are located close to (less than a kilometer), and in some cases, are immediately adjacent to, the areas they originally occupied. Two RAPs have been prepared for Obeyesekerepura and Madampityahereandhere.Under the guidance of the ESMPF, the ESMP will be prepared for each sub-project site. The ESMPs will analyze the potential environmental and social risks and impacts related to the project activities (during and after construction). The ESMPs will also propose measures needed to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and to improve the environmental and social performance of the Project. During preparation of the ESMPs, public consultation will be carried out with identified stakeholders, namely with the project-affected people, to seek their views, concerns and feedback, to further enhance the project design and mitigation measures.A project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) is in place to allow project-affected people to raise their concerns and resolve outstanding issues.",,Category A,OK

The purpose of the ESMPF is to ensure that the proposed project activities are assessed and implemented in conformity with the policies of the Republic of Uzbekistan as well as the AIIB’s ESP and ESSs. The ESMPF identifies generic impacts of the project activities and identifies generic mitigation measures to address these impacts. The ESMPF and RPF provide policy, methodology and procedures for environmental and social (ES) studies of the site-specific activities.Environmental aspects.The Project is expected to generate benefits in terms of improving the efficiency of water use and enhancing water environment and public health security in the Bukhara Region. The Project will cause temporary adverse environmental impacts during construction and operations. These impacts would include damage to crops, generation of solid wastes including hazardous wastes, noise, dust, air pollution, wastewater, impacts on cultural heritage, disturbance to community and traffic, damage to public utilities, influx of labor, health hazards and labor safety issues due to facility siting, civil works and operation and maintenance. Mitigation measures to address these adverse impacts and occupational health and safety issues are included in the generic ESMP and will be specified in site-specific ESMPs. In addition, third-party monitoring consultants will be engaged by the Project to develop semi-annual Environmental and Social Monitoring Reports. The Environmental and Social Monitoring Reports will focus on the implementation of the ESMPs.Climate change.This Project aims to improve the efficiency of water use and sustainable water management in the Bukhara Region. The measures proposed under the Project are expected to help the communities to better adapt to the scarcity of water resources due to climate change, and to improve energy efficiency of the facilities, which will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions during operation.Social and gender aspects.It is possible that people using the lands of proposed facilities, both title holders and non-title holders will be physically or economically displaced. During the process of detailed design, efforts will be made to avoid or minimize the physical and economic displacement. The Project-affected People’s (PAP’s) income/livelihood loss will be compensated in accordance with the provisions of ESS 2 and the principles set out in the RPF. Women and children will be specific beneficiaries of this Project due to the household connections of clean and safe water supply. A survey has been carried out to prepare a Gender Action Plan (GAP), which will be updated during the implementation of this Project.Stakeholder engagement, consultation, and information disclosure.Stakeholder consultations have been carried out during the preparation of the ESMPF in the form of focus group discussions, interviews and workshops. The ESMPF also sets out procedures and requirements on stakeholder engagement, public consultation and information disclosure at site-specific level during the implementation of the Project. The ESMPF in English and Russian languages and the Executive Summary in Uzbek have been disclosed on the website of Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (and later on thewebsiteof the new Project Implementing Entity JSC Uzsuvtaminot) since Jan 31, 2020 and the links are made available on the AIIBwebsite. Hardcopies of the documents in the two local languages are also available in the project area. Once the site-specific ESIAs, ESMPs and RPs are prepared and approved, they will also be disclosed in a similar manner.GRM.A two-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) for PAPs at the field-level and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) level has been proposed in accordance with the requirements of AIIB’s ESP. A separate GRM for workers will deal exclusively with those complaints that involve workers for construction activities. The PCU-level GRM has been established during the implementation of the ongoing AIIB-supported Phase I project, which will be used for Phase II project if AIIB is satisfied with its performance. The field-level GRMs will be established when the Supervision Consultants and Contractors for the respective phases of this Project are onboard. Information of established project-level GRM including Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of AIIB in local languages will be timely disclosed to project-affected people in an appropriate manner.",,Category A,OK

However, this area is currently connected to the national grid network by a transmission line over 45 years old, which has reliability issues. Given the potential of that region, the CEB has planned to construct a new transmission network from the New Habarana Grid substation to the Kappalthurai Grid substation with financial support from AIIB, emphasizing the need for transmission network capacity expansion in the project area. The following activities are planned in the project scope:Construction of around 77-km 220kV double circuit transmission line from New Habarana GSS to Kappalthurai GSSAugmentation and modification of New Habarana GSS (220/132 kV) and Kappalthurai GSS (220/33 kV)","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB's Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), applies to this project. ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) apply, while ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. The scope of the project is to construct a double circuit, 220kV transmission line from New Habarana to Kappalthurai, which is about 77 km in length. The project has been classified as Category B following the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), as there are a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (ES) impacts, these impacts are not unprecedented or irreversible and can be managed through operational good international practice.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) has been prepared based on Sri Lanka’s National Regulations. This IEE has been approved by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Currently, consultants have been mobilized to prepare an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) report, including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) to align to AIIB ESF. Further, instruments will be identified and prepared as necessary according to the preliminary results of the ESIA.Environment Aspects.The project alignment will mostly traverse to paddy fields, and some forest patches. This has already been closely coordinated with Sri Lanka’s Forest Department to ensure an alignment route with lesser impacts to the biodiversity. Initial anticipated impacts for the project will not result in a significant loss of flora species as they are neither unique nor restricted to the project area habitats and will not cause serious disruption of migratory routes for fauna species. During the construction phase, the impacts anticipated for the project includes accumulation of hazardous wastes, pollution risks to surface and groundwater, and soil, tree loss, topsoil erosion, dust emissions and effects to noise and vibrations. Impacts during operation include possible collision of mammals and birds and bats to the transmission towers and cables. This ESIA will identify and address risks and impacts of the project through physical environment, ecological and critical habitat assessment.Social Aspects.Land will be required for the tower footing, which may include from farmers that use land as a primary source of income. There is also a risk of livelihood disruption during construction due to reduced access to land and farming activities. The project has been designed to minimize the number of households affected by the project and will avoid the need for resettlement. Vulnerable groups, including seasonal worker, female-headed households, low-income households, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facing potential livelihood disruption and risks related to worker influx will be identified in the ESIA, and additional instruments prepared as needed. These will be reviewed by AIIB to ensure compliance with AIIB’s ESP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The health and safety risks to local communities are expected during the implementation phase given that construction will occur on land which is adjacent to schools, roads, and houses, and on farming land with heavy footfall during harvest season. Unskilled labor will be sourced from seasonal workers in local communities, but skilled labor is expected to be externally recruited, creating risks related to labor influx. There are also risks relating to OHS and working conditions such as working at height, live power lines and lightning strike risks. The ESIA will elaborate further and recommend the necessary instruments to avoid and mitigate risks, including OHS, community health and safety, traffic, child abuse and gender-based violence (GBV)/ sexual exploitation (SE)/ sexual harassment (SH), and labor and working conditions.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The key stakeholders include government, farmer organizations, and community members, including those from vulnerable and marginalized groups. Initial consultations identified a low awareness amongst community members around the development benefits of transmission lines, and concerns surrounding adverse health effects of the proposed infrastructure. Further consultations will be conducted to inform the preparation of the ESIA. ES documentation prepared for the project will be timely disclosed to the local communities by the client in an appropriate manner. AIIB will also disclose those ES documentation at its website timely.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Building on the existing complaint mechanisms of CEB, a two-tier GRM will be constituted for the project in line with the Bank’s ESP. Communities and individuals who believe they are adversely affected by the project will be able to submit complaints to the project-level GRM for resolution. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for workers' grievances. The information of established GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The PMU will be fully responsible for monitoring the project's implementation and is expected to prepare progress reports semi-annually based on agreed format highlighting progress on the implementation of ES plans. During implementation of the project, the Bank will conduct regular field supervision missions to monitor and verify the progress. The frequency of the missions will depend on implementation progress and complexity.",USD35 million,Category B,OK

To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing environmental and social (ES) aspects of the Project, and as permitted by AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB’s ESP), EBRD’s Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD’s ESP 2019) and relevant Performance Requirements (PRs) will apply to this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP (consistent with above referred two earlier projects). AIIB has reviewed the EBRD’s ESP and PRs and is satisfied that: (i) they are consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including AIIB’s Environmental and Social Exclusion List and the relevant ES Standards; and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. EBRD has categorized the ES risks of the project as Category A (which is equivalent to Category A if AIIB’s ESP were applicable).Environmental and Social Instruments.As required by the ESP of EBRD, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was prepared to address the anticipated ES risks and impacts in the Project Components and associated facilities and remediation of any issues including legacy issues. The ESIA also includes a cumulative impact assessment, Noise and Air Pollution assessments, Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), Corrective Action Plan (CAP) prepared based on land audit undertaken to assess the resettlement impacts so far and identify measures to address any gaps with EBRD’s PR5. The ESIA is applicable to the long-term financing (LTF) stage as well, as the risks and impacts are duly assessed in the ESIA. The Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) prepared to address the gaps between the Project mitigation measures and the EBRD’s ESP requirements is updated to reflect the residual and applicable time bound actions to be implemented during the LTF project period.Environmental Aspects.The Project does not involve any additional activities beyond the initial project and only facilitates LTF. The construction phase related ES risks and impacts such as dust emissions, water contamination, noise, removal of construction debris, etc. are being managed through the implementation of the ESMP or ESAP. The quarterly reports of Independent Lenders’ ES Consultant (IESC) confirmed that the ESAP implementation is on course without any material deviations. At the peak of construction activities in January 2024 a construction labor audit was conducted, and no major non-compliances were identified. In January 2025 a second audit was carried out in respect of demobilization phase of construction and the corrective actions are included in the LTF ESAP. For the operational phase during the LTF period, the major environmental impacts are cumulative noise impact, air pollution, solid waste (including hazard waste), and wastewater. ESAP is revised to reflect operational stage impacts and includes ES screening of associated facilities as per Management of Change Plan and identification of measures to manage impacts. Noise management plan and Voluntary noise insulation program is under review and revision by experts. Assessment of the houses eligible under VNIP is part of ESAP and will be completed by July 2025.The webpage of the Antalya airport facilitates capturing noise related grievances by the community and stakeholders.Social Aspects.A land acquisition audit was conducted during the ESIA process and a CAP in the form of supplementary livelihood improvement plan (SLIP) is prepared providing a detailed and specific implementation plan to mitigate the vulnerabilities of Project-affected People (PAPs) following the earlier pre-Project expropriation process. SLIP is a detailed implementation plan inclusive of a vulnerable people’s program, a house improvement program, a greenhouse program and an employability enhancement program and details on grievance redress mechanisms. LTF ESAP includes review of the SLIP, based on first half year of implementation. A Community Liaison Officer (CLO) is engaged for the Project to support effective implementation of SLIP as well as coordinate grievance redressal. The SLIP programs are expected to be accomplished by 2029-2030.Gender.The potential occupational and community health and safety risks, including those related to labor influx and Gender-Based violence, sexual exploitation, assault, and harassment (GBV-SEAH), were assessed in line with EBRD’s PR4. A standalone Gender-Based Violence and Harassment Due Diligence (GBVH) was prepared to capture various actions, including the involvement of women in project planning and execution. GRM includes any complaint, suggestion or request on GBVH cases, allowing anonymous complaints to be registered and assessed. As part of implementation, a gender focal person is assigned to manage and coordinate GBVH related issues as well as act as a direct contact for GBVH related complaints.Community, and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The ESIA identified occupational health and safety (OHS) risks during the construction and O&M phases. The OHS requirements are included in the contractor's site-specific Environment Management Plans (EMPs). Similarly, issues related to the influx of labor and code of conduct have been addressed in the EMPs. The Borrower requires that contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and regulations and adopt and enforce codes of conduct for all workers. The ESAP progress tracker as well as quarterly 3rd party report by IESC have not identified any concerns. The IESC monitoring report concluded that construction labor conditions are following ESAP requirements.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The stand-alone Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) is prepared tailored according to gender considerations is being reviewed to update for LTF and will be disclosed once revised. Stakeholder engagement is ongoing per SEP between 2022 and 2025.

The ESSA is complemented by a Program Action Plan (PAP) at the operational level. While the Bank finds that the ESSA/PAP provides an appropriate and acceptable approach under the SRSSP-2 for management of these issues, it differs in scope and methodology from the Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies used by the WB for conventional sector investment project financing. Therefore, the Program will use the WB’s environmental and social procedures applicable to the PforR Policy and as specifically applied to the SRSSP-2, based on a waiver of AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP). The ESSA and PAP have been subject to consultation and have been disclosed by the WB onhttp://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/ 174281528990876317/. The overall environmental and social impact of the SRSSP-2 is expected to be positive. It will support adequate collection and treatment of sewage, according to the standards of Egyptian legislation. In accordance with the PforR Policy, the SRSSP-2 will exclude activities that are likely to have significant adverse environmental and social impacts that are sensitive, irreversible, or unprecedented (equivalent to Category A). The country systems were reviewed to ascertain their adequacy to address the environmental and social risks and impacts as identified during the ESSA. The country’s legislation related to environmental safeguards was found to be adequate; gaps in the legislation pertaining to land acquisition have been addressed through formulation of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for securing land. Consequently, the country’s environmental and social management system, based on the ESSA, will be applied for the SRSSP-2 given that the environmental and social risks and impacts are 4 moderate in nature, limited in their scope and can be successfully managed by known and tested measures (equivalent to Category B).",,Category B,OK

Preliminary study shows that for many buildings retrofitting are not technically and economically feasible. Therefore, reconstruction of these buildings will be required after demolition of the old structures. Feasibility study reports that these additional buildings are being carried out and funded by the KfW Development Bank (KfW).Similar to the previous ISMEP project financed by AIIB, this additional financing Project comprises of three components as shown below.Component A: Enhancing Emergency Preparedness This component aims to enhance the emergency preparedness of the City of Istanbul by strengthening the capacity of Istanbul’s Provincial Directorate of Disaster and Emergency and other first responders.Component B: Seismic Risk Mitigation for Public Facilities This component is to reduce the risk of future earthquake damages to critical public facilities in order to save lives and ensure their continued functioning operation in the event of an earthquake. The component will mainly consist of retrofitting and reconstruction of the existing priority public facilities such as schools, hospitals, and other social facilities (daycare centers, aged group homes for the elderly, and orphanages, etc.). The component may also support feasibility studies, detailed designs, and construction supervision. The Project’s implementing entity, IPCU, has already identified about 40 buildings to be included in the project based on the ISMEP program’s established rules.Component C: Project Management Support This component will support IPCU to implement the Project in an efficient and transparent manner and continue to build the institutional capacity to sustain the implementation of the Seismic Risk Mitigation and Preparedness program beyond the life of the Project.","Environmental and Social Policy, Standards and Categorization. AIIB's Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) applies to the Project. The Project has been prepared consistent with the Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) applies to the Project. ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) and ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) are not triggered, as Project activities will not cause involuntary resettlement and no Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have a collective attachment to, the Project area. The Project is assigned Category B, by the ESP due to the limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social impacts of the construction activities that can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting.Instruments.An Environmental Management Plan (EMP), based on the Environmental and Social Management Plan Framework (ESMPF) established under the World Bank financed ISMEP project and adopted by the other IFIs in the ISMEP Program, was prepared per the Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies of the World Bank and has been in place since the program's inception in 2005 and was updated in 2010. The EMP was further updated in 2019 as part of this Project to reflect new regulatory requirements in Türkiye and to codify existing practices related to stakeholder engagement and grievance management. In addition, the Project prepared an Environmental and Social Completion Report, and the EMP was revised further to attend the AIIB's ESF.Environmental Aspects.The Project is not expected to have any significant adverse impact on any sensitive environmental receptors. Construction activities will temporarily result in localized noise, dust and combustion emissions, construction waste generation, and potentially sedimentation of the sewage system on and near project sites. Off-site impacts will be induced by the production of construction material, including but not limited to the use of natural resources such as water and energy consumption, their transportation to the site, and the disposal of debris and other waste. The EMP has special provisions for hazardous waste materials such as asbestos and sensitive impacts such as noise and dust management.Social Aspects.The Project will not induce any physical or economic resettlement. Social impacts will comprise construction-induced nuisances such as noise, dust emissions, access restriction, and risks to community health and safety for adjacent residents and structures and concurrent users of facilities or buildings being renovated while potentially in partial use, such as schools or hospitals. Public buildings targeted for reconstruction will adopt universal design principles. During the construction, student and teachers will be reallocated to nearby facilities to minimize learning disruption. Transition plan and actions to mitigate any significant adverse impact on the students and teachers' access to educational buildings, preceding the assessment and temporary relocation of the facilities.Cultural Resources.None of the targeted buildings are located within registered cultural heritage areas. However, due to the historical nature of Istanbul, activities to be conducted as part of the Project may occur adjacent to or near important cultural resources. During Project preparation, one contractor reported a 'Chance Find' associated with a previously retrofitted building, and two buildings had monument/registered trees onsite. For buildings near known cultural resources such as registered trees, contractors must receive approval from the Regional Preservation Council and mitigation measures must be implemented to protect the cultural resource. In the 'Chance of Finds' case, the Regional Preservation Council will assign an expert to supervise excavation under an approved plan.Labor and Working Conditions.Project activities will involve construction risks such as earthworks, excavations, work in height, noise, underground activities, and electrical hazards during construction. The Contractors will develop management plans by the EMP. The Contractors will implement an occupational health and safety plan, including work-related accident prevention and an emergency response plan. IPCU is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the mitigation measures. The Contractors must adopt and implement Human Resource policies aligned with AIIB's requirements, especially for preventing Labor and Working Conditions issues across their operations and those of the contractors and subcontractors.Gender and Accessibility Aspects.All schools and hospitals are designed using accessibility facilities such as ramps and elevators and have adequate facilities for women, such as separate bathrooms. As part of the enhancement of the Project, IPCU will include Gender-Based Violence (GBV) training sessions on the EMP, and opportunities for equal access to employment will also be identified. In addition, the Project will use universal design features for people with disabilities.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure. All construction projects are subject to public consultations, as Turkish regulations require. Therefore, the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for further meaningful consultation during project preparation and implementation has been prepared and integrated into the updated EMP. The process includes public hearings, focus group discussions, interviews, surveys, and communication materials. Particular attention will be paid to the inclusion of men and women in all consultations to ensure that their respective priorities and concerns are considered, particularly in the planning and execution of the Project. TheEMPand its executive summary inEnglishandTurkishare available on the AIIB’s and Project's websites.Project’s Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). A Project-levelGrievance Redress Mechanism (GRM)has been developed and implemented, which includes multiple channels for stakeholders to raise grievances to IPCU and a process for investigating and responding to grievances. During Project preparation, the functionality of the GRM was assessed through a review of several successfully closed cases. As a result, a second GRM will be established for project workers as a condition for the finance. The information of established GRMs for the Project as well as the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of the Bank both in English and local language will be disclosed timely in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The IPCU will be responsible for the overall coordination, supervision, and monitoring of the Project's environmental and social (E&S) aspects and to ensure compliance with Bank ESP requirements. The IPCU has established an environmental and social specialist team to oversee Project implementation and monitor environmental and social aspects. The IPCU will provide to AIIB with semi-annual E&S monitoring reports, which will be prepared based on an agreed format, during the Project implementation period. In addition, AIIB will conduct E&S supervision missions in line with the Bank's implementation support missions and strengthen the IPCU's E&S management efforts.",,Category B,OK

It is one of the largest transportations routes traversing through Kazakhstan, linking the East with the West. The Project will focus on improving the road conditions and implementing road safety measures and climate resilient standards. The Project will also support the toll system of the road to enhance its self-sustainability. It is among the pioneers in using an integrated Design Build and Maintain (DBM) contract model using an Output Performance- Based Road Contract (OPBRC) format. This integrated contract model allows mobilizing private sector expertise to develop project design and long-term maintenance program up-front to suit specific project features, therefore facilitating a lifecycle approach to road infrastructure planning. It will also reduce the risk of cost overruns and implementation delays faced in the conventional input-based contract model.The total Project cost is estimated at USD1,124 million. The Project will be co-financed by AIIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Each Bank is expected to provide its sovereign backed loan of USD502 million respectively. The remaining USD120 million of total project cost, including taxes, will be covered by counterpart funding.The Project comprises two components:Component 1. Resilient and Safe Road ConnectivityComponent 2. Capacity Building and Implementation Support","Applicable Policy and Categorization:The Project will be co-financed with the EBRD. To support a harmonized approach to addressing environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) and relevant Performance Requirements (PRs) are applicable for this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. The Bank has reviewed EBRD ESP and PRs and is satisfied that (i) the ESP and PRs are consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the relevant ES Standards (ESS) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. The Project is categorized as Category A by the EBRD (equivalent to Category A as per AIIB’s ESP) due to the scale and magnitude of ES impacts of this Project that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to relevant ESSs, procedures, and guidelines.Environmental and Social Instruments:During project preparation the Borrower prepared, consulted on, and disclosed the following instruments: a) Draft Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA); b) Draft Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP); c) Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF); d) Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) and e) Labor Management Plan (LMP) as part of the ESMP. The Contractors will prepare and implement site-specific Contractors’ ESMPs (CESMPs) with thematic ES management plans detailing the procedures and measures to prevent and manage the stated adverse impacts and risks.Environment Aspects:The Project’s potential environmental risks and impacts primarily stem from the reconstruction and expansion of the existing M-32 highway, including road widening, bypass construction, and associated infrastructure works. The key environmental risks/impacts include habitat disturbance, dust generation, noise and vibration from construction activities, and risks of pollution from construction waste, fuel spills, and improper waste disposal. While the Project does not traverse legally protected areas, Ramsar sites, or Key Biodiversity Areas, it may impact local biodiversity through habitat fragmentation, potential roadkill incidents, and disturbances to wildlife movement. No critical habitats for endangered species have been identified along the alignment. Following the biodiversity assessment, a draft biodiversity management plan (BMP) has been prepared. The proposed mitigation measures include designated wildlife crossings (if necessary), fencing, and biodiversity monitoring. Additional environmental concerns arise from the quarrying and sourcing of sand, aggregates, and other construction materials, as well as the transportation of significant volumes of these materials, which could lead to increased dust emissions, fuel consumption, and road safety risks. Certain sections of the Project are also characterized by high water tables, posing potential risks of groundwater contamination and requiring careful drainage management. To address these concerns, measures such as optimized material sourcing, erosion control, and groundwater protection strategies may be incorporated.Social and Gender Aspects:The proposed Project is expected to generate positive social benefits for the local population, including improved travel conditions and road safety, reduced transportation costs, travel time, and congestion. The social risks and potential impacts are associated with land acquisition and restrictions on land use during construction, as well as community health and safety associated with potential labor influx. The Project does not anticipate major livelihood impacts related to land acquisition. The estimated number of project-affected people (PAPs) is 60, consisting of owners of private and state-owned land plots, businesses, industrial zones, farmers, and tenants of pasturelands. One of the sections under construction is considered an associated facility and the resettlement related legacy issues will be addressed in line with the LARF. The Borrower will develop a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) once detailed designs are finalized. The Project may require relocation of relevant utilities (power and telecom lines). Relevant mitigation measures are included in the ESIA/ESMP and will be cascaded to Contractors’ ESMPs.Gender Aspects.The Project will assist the Borrower in amending bidding documents for civil works to require selected firms to develop and submit gender-sensitive Local Employment and Procurement Plans to improve female representation within their workforces. Given the large influx of labor in the region, Gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) cases may arise during the construction phase. To mitigate these risks, the Contractor(s) will develop and implement GBVH Action Plan(s), outlining specific measures to address and manage GBVH risks and impacts throughout the Project.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions (LWC):The Project will involve typical construction-related OHS risks, like work-related accidents, mechanical and load-handling hazards, exposure to hazardous chemicals and materials, risks associated with the operation of heavy machinery, electric shock, extreme weather conditions, air quality issues, noise and vibration exposure, and road traffic hazards and safety due to the movement of construction vehicles and equipment. To mitigate these risks, the ESMP includes detailed OHS measures, which will be further integrated into the Contractors’ site-specific OHS Plan. LWC risks/impacts related to sub-standard working practices will be managed through implementation of LMP. Contractors’ LMP will include relevant procedures to be established and maintained to manage LWC risks and impacts during both construction and operation phases.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultations, and Information Disclosure:During project preparation consultations were carried out with potential PAPs and interested stakeholders identified as part of SEP prepared. The Borrower supported by local governments will utilize diverse range of existing channels at the local level to consult with PAPs and address their concerns during resettlement activities. During construction, the Contractors will be required to regularly conduct consultations with the local communities and report to the Borrower monthly. The draft ES instruments were disclosed in English and the local languages (Russian and Kazakh) at the Borrower’swebsite. They will subsequently be disclosed on the Bank’s website 60 days prior to financing approval.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM):The SEP includes a detailed description of the Project-level GRM, which will be available at national and district levels. The mechanism allows grievances to be submitted through multiple channels, including in-person, via phone, email, or through the websites of QAJ and the respective local governments (Akimats). Complaints received at the local level, such as through the Akimats, contractors or community leaders, will be forwarded to the PIU for further processing. The Worker GRM will also be established and communicated to all project workers through written and verbal communication. The information of established GRMs and the Independent Project Accountability Mechanism (IPAM) of EBRD will be timely disclosed to the local communities in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.The Borrower will be responsible for coordination, supervision, and monitoring of the Project in compliance with the EBRD’s ESP and PRs, and management of the project-level GRMs. The Borrower will submit semi-annual monitoring reports based on the agreed format to EBRD and AIIB. As the lead co-financier, EBRD will oversee the Project’s supervision in accordance with EBRD’s applicable policies and procedures, and AIIB ES specialists will join EBRD to conduct field monitoring and supervision.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable while ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) and ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) are not applicable as the Project did not have any land acquisition impacts and there are no Indigenous Peoples identified as being in the Akmola Region according to the environmental and social (ES) due diligence (ESDD).The Project is assigned Category B in accordance with the ESP due to potential operation and maintenance (O&M) phase manageable risks associated with biodiversity, occupational health and safety, shadow flicker nuisance and pollution prevention and control for the wind farm, and the assessed scale of risks and impacts, committed mitigation and very limited impacts on landowners associated with the overhead transmission line developed to evacuate power to the grid.Environmental and Social Instruments.A Non-Technical Summary (NTS) that describes the key potential impacts and mitigations associated with the Project has been prepared. Following AIIB’s due diligence the NTS is supplemented by an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) that addresses gaps identified by AIIB in (1) the Project ES assessment and (2) in the O&M ES management arrangements related to the full suite of subprojects. These measures include a small number of additional biodiversity surveys and assessments, measures to confirm and manage potential shadow flicker and noise impacts and a supplementary assessment updated to account for the results of these actions. A series of audits to verify institutional management systems, plans and capacity have also been committed in the ESAP but do not constitute ES instruments for this project. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has also been prepared. The SEP is a living document that will be regularly updated, as necessary.Environmental Aspects.Outstanding construction phase activities are limited to reinstatement of disturbed ground. Notable O&M phase potential risks and impacts include bird and bat collision-related fatalities, noise, occupational health and safety and shadow flickering. The level of assessment completed to date provides sufficient comfort that these residual risks and impacts will not be significant, and a monitoring program is committed to ground-truth this prediction.The ESAP includes for the development of a Habitat Management Plan that will capture actions to be taken in the event natural revegetation is not successful.The ESIA included a biodiversity risk analysis based on the Bank’s ESF. The results confirmed that the wind farm is not located in any biodiversity sensitive areas, and there are no protected or designated nature reserves that could be affected by the Project. The potential risk of bird collision and/or electrocution impacts from the turbines and power lines is not predicted to be significant and appropriate mitigations to reduce impacts to as low as reasonably practicable have been identified and are committed. In addition, there are limited wastes and hazardous materials generated / required for the O&M phase for regular maintenance, but a waste management plan for O&M activities will be determined by undertaking third party audits specified in the ESAP.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project Sponsor holds long-term lease rights for 371.7 ha in total for all five subprojects. All leased land plots are state land and managed by the Land Management Department of Arshalinsk district authority. Land lease fees will be paid to the account of the State Income Management Department of the Arshalinsk district. Lease right grants use of land plots for construction and operation of a wind power station, access roads and power lines. Hence there are no land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts under this project.The most relevant gender issue for the proposed Project is equal access to employment opportunities during the operation of the WPPs. The potential gender actions related to gender-inclusive employment and work environment, notably in terms of access to employment that may be generated during operation, as well as by providing adequate infrastructure and safe working conditions for both male and female staff. The Bank requires the adoption of (i) a Code of Conduct for Workers with anti gender-based violence (GBV) and antidiscrimination provisions to be included in Human Resource policy and (ii) work out with the Sponsor on the adoption of appropriate measures to mitigate risks of GBV and sexual harassment and include as part of the ESAP actions.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions and Supply Chain.A number of potential gaps in health and safety management systems of all parties have been identified and a program of third-party health, safety, and environment (HSE) audits to review conformance with the Bank’s requirements have been specified in the ESAP. In addition to the labor audit at the facility level, a risk screening of the core/primary suppliers to the Project supplier was conducted to review potential issues relating to labor and working conditions at the supplier/vendor level. The findings of the labor audit and supplier risk screening informs the corrective actions on the improvement of the supplier management and traceability system for the Project and included in the ESAP, supplemented by the Project and its supplier's commitments on labor and working conditions in their supply chains.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.To strengthen the stakeholder engagement process with Project stakeholders the Borrower has prepared a SEP in accordance with AIIB’s ESP. The SEP provides an overview of the engagement activities undertaken, as well as proposed, for the Project, and details the grievance redress mechanism (GRM) for Project stakeholders.

Dh. Kulhudhuffushi is situated 277 km away from the capital city of Malé. It has the second- largest patient catchment area after the Capital Malé. The potential number of beneficiaries exceeds 75,000, comprising the residents of the island and nearby atolls. This Project activity aims to address the critical shortage of quarantine facilities for highly contagious and transmissible diseases. Additionally, this facility can serve as patient accommodation for those traveling from other islands. It aims to construct a two-story medical facility with 14 individual and separated wards, along with ancillary services for staff.Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Training.The objective is to provide infection prevention training to 70% of the doctors, nurses, and healthcare This training will provide healthcare workers with the ongoing IPC education. The aim is to instill a risk-management mindset in all aspects of patient care. This will help to minimize the possibility of infection propagation amongst healthcare workers, patients, and visitors. To achieve this, a consistent method for auditing infection prevention and control systems, procedures, and adherence will be developed at medical facilities.Project Management.The existing project management unit (PMU) will continue to operate to oversee daily coordination, contract management, payment process, and the implementation aspects of the Project. To perform its duty, PMU requires an internal auditor, a financial management specialist, a social and environmental specialist, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, and a civil engineer.","Applicable Policy and the Instruments.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) will apply for the remaining project activities over the extended loan period.

DEG’s ES Standards are found to be consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and with the provisions of AIIB’s ES Exclusion List (ESEL) and relevant ES Standards.DEG has assigned Category B+ (equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable) to the Project, considering the outputs from the ESDD, the need for strengthening the Borrower’s capacity to adequately implement the ESAP, and considering that the Project’s construction was almost complete at the time of the ESDD.Environmental and Social Instruments.The Borrower prepared the draft ESIA following the IFC Performance Standards as the Reference Framework. The ESIA also includes a non-technical summary of ESIA (NTS), an ES Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP), and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP). An initial brief red flag analysis was conducted by an independent consultant to assess critical ES risks of the Project. The Lender’s ES Advisor (LESA) was engaged to conduct an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) of the Project, to review the draft ESIA, and assess the adequacy of the Borrower’s Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). The gap analysis conducted as part of the ESDD process has resulted in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), consisting of ES time-bound mitigation actions to be carried out by the Borrower to address the Project’s ES risks and impacts in compliance with DEG’s ES Standards.Environmental Aspects.The Project will support the production of renewable energy through solar power and BESS in Cambodia, thereby mitigating the issues associated with power scarcity and intermittent energy supply to the national grid and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Project could potentially have adverse environmental impacts, if not managed carefully. Potential adverse environmental impacts from construction and operation activities include (i) biodiversity impact on the proximal community fish refuge, (ii) potential flooding in surrounding areas due to the diversion of streamflow from a cut-off creek that traversed the Project site, (iii) disturbance to local traffic and community health and safety, (iv) contamination of surface water, soil and groundwater due to stormwater and sedimentation runoff and increased water demand for solar PV panels cleaning, (v) erosion of open areas around the project site that may lead to unstable slopes, (vi) waste from construction spoils and any hazardous electronic waste generated from the spoilt solar panels and BESS, (vii) temporary construction-related noise and dust impacts, and (viii) relevant potential environmental impacts from associated facilities (if determined during the final ESDD) such as access roads, substations, transformers, and transmission lines. The project’s ESAP will include measures to address the key ES impacts including Borrower’s commitment to develop and implement relevant ES management plans and policies.Social Aspects.The Project has provided significant benefits to nearby communities through employment generation for both men and women. As the Borrower has completed construction during the ESDD review process, attention was paid to assessing if the Project involved any social risks related land acquisition and resettlement. Following discussions with community members and local authorities, both the ESIA and ESDD reports confirm that land acquisition was carried out on a voluntary basis, using a willing buyer/willing seller approach. The reports also indicate that there are no legacy issues or ongoing complaints relating to land acquisition. As construction was due to complete, the ESDD proposed priority measures to enhance labor and working conditions, safety of workers and community nearby. The risks of sexual exploitation and abuse/sexual harassment was equally assessed as low, as the Project mostly employed local labor within the local communities. Moving forward, the ESDD report proposes measures for the Borrower to enhance the Borrower’s ESMS at the company and operations and maintenance levels that shall also apply to its contractors.Gender Aspects.The review of the Borrower’s ESMS has resulted in actions proposed for the Borrower to integrate gender into the Project. This includes the requirement for the Borrower to provide local communities, particularly women groups, with employment and skill training opportunities. The draft ESAP also proposes measures to strengthen the Borrower’s Human Resources Policy and Manual, by ensuring that policy shall take into account key requirements in line with the IFC Standards, such as equal treatment of workers, anti-harassment and gender-based violence, as well as worker’s grievance mechanism.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The ESDD reviewed the health and safety plans and procedures of the Borrower and proposes measures to address risks related to labor and working conditions and occupational health and safety. These measures include the need for the Borrower to development and enhance a Human Resource Policy, Code of Conduct, occupational health and safety plan, and emergency response plan. The risks related to labor and working conditions in the supply chain were part of the DEG’s due diligence process. Additional actions would be carried out by AIIB, as part of the Bank’s due diligence of the labor and working conditions in the supply chain. Appropriate representations and warranties related to labor and working conditions will be included in the finance documents and incorporated in Project contract.Stakeholder Engagement, Information Disclosure, and Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.Consultations were carried out with relevant stakeholders as part of the ESIA and ESDD process.

Therefore, the environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts are being assessed in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS). To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the BCIB Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), ADB’s SPS will apply to the BCIB Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed ADB’s SPS and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and the relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs); and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the BCIB Project. ADB has categorized the ES risks of the BCIB Project as Category A for Environment, A for Involuntary Resettlement and C for Indigenous Peoples (which are equivalent to Category A if AIIB’s ESP were applicable). The category is based on risks due to large-scale construction activities and significant impacts on marine ecosystems and displacement of the project-affected peoples (PAP).Environment and Social instruments.An Initial Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was conducted from 2019–2021 in parallel with the feasibility study and preliminary design process. This EIA was then updated based on detailed design from and the draft report was disclosed in the ADB and DPWH websites in July 2023 followed by the Final EIA in November 2023. In compliance with the Philippine Presidential Decree No. 1586, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) report was also prepared and submitted to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in February 2021 and Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) was obtained for the BCIB project on 25 April 2021.An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and an Environmental Monitoring plan (EMoP) have been formulated to mitigate and monitor the negative impacts during various phases (preconstruction, construction and operation) of the project to acceptable levels. The EMP is supplemented by detailed sub-plans including Traffic Management Plans, Social Development Plan and IEC Framework, as well as an emergency preparedness and response framework that address key impacts/risks of the BCIB Project. In addition, a standalone Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) has been prepared, which will continue to be updated throughout the pre-construction phase. On social aspect, a Resettlement Framework (RF) was prepared to provide guidance in the preparation of a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP) for the proposed BCIB Project. The RF sets out requirements in terms of standards, entitlements, and practices to be applied by the GoP to ensure that involuntary resettlement impacts caused by the BCIB Project are appropriately assessed and mitigated. Subsequently, a LARP has been prepared for the BCIB Project. The LARP has adequately addressed most of the issues for mitigating the social impacts, including the loss of shelter and income, and has proposed relocation and income restoration. Information about the BCIB Project has been disclosed and adequate consultations with the stakeholders have taken place and this exercise will be continued throughout the project cycle.Environmental Aspect.The BCIB Project is anticipated to yield environmental benefits on a regional basis, notably reducing air pollution from traffic congestion in the larger Metro Manila area. However, environmental impacts within the project corridor are expected to be significant in construction phase, albeit temporary, in the absence of mitigation measures. Therefore, robust ES instruments have been prepared. Given the extent of the construction works, temporary impacts on the marine environment are anticipated. There are no protected areas or key biodiversity areas in the near vicinity of the project corridor, however there are two locally managed marine protected areas found within 10km of the project alignment. In addition to the marine protected areas, a number of potential endangered species were identified and therefore a Critical Habitat Assessment (CIA) is under preparation. The EIA, EMP and Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) caters for the potential ecological impacts with respective mitigation measure and monitoring plans outlined. In the operational stage, given that the Manila Bay area is considered to be an important bird area for migratory species, a Bird Management Plan will be formulated addressing potential impacts associated with collision risk with the bridge. During the construction phase, water quality impacts associated with works for the foundations such as dredging and piling are anticipated, especially with respect to sedimentation. To that end these impacts have been assessed and mitigated with construction phasing and measures such as silt curtains. Noise and air quality impacts have also been assessed in both the construction and operational phase, with noise barriers to be installed as required. Throughout the Construction and Operations phases the EMP should be followed by the implementation agency and contractors to ensure impacts are properly mitigated and monitored.Social Aspect.The involuntary resettlement impacts are likely to be significant. ADB has classified the BCIB Project as Category A for involuntary resettlement. Involuntary resettlement is anticipated in the BCIB Project due to land acquisition. It will require land acquisition in Package 1 (Barangays Alas-asin and Mt. View) and Package 2 (Barangays Timalan-Concepcion and Timalan-Balsahan), with more land needed on the Bataan side. The affected lands are mostly agricultural, and there are some residential, commercial, industrial, and other types of lands (e.g., private roads, mixed-use development, beach land, railroad, residential-agricultural, and open space subdivisions). Furthermore, the land acquisition will have impact on residential and commercial structures, community and institutional structures, trees and plants, and existing roads and easements. It will result in the displacement of households, business owners, and workers, with more PAP expected in the Cavite land side. In addition, the impacts and risks associated with labour influx have also been assessed. The EMP includes guidance to prepare a Workers’ Accommodation Management Plan and to address Gender-Based Violence (GBV). The provisions will be incorporated into the tender documents.Gender aspects.ADB has categorized the BCIB Project as effective gender mainstreaming. A project is assigned effective gender mainstreaming as the BCIB Project outputs are designed to directly improve women’s access to social services, and/or economic and financial resources and opportunities, and/or basic rural and urban infrastructure, and/or enhancing voices and rights, which contribute to gender equality and women's empowerment. There is a positive correlation between the influx of male construction workers and the rise in GBV-SEAH (Sexual Exploitation, Abuse and Harassment) cases in construction sites when there are no mitigation measures to protect women and children. As major civil works are involved, there is the possibility of occurrence of GBV-SEAH in project site and surrounding areas. A Gender Assessment and Action Plan (GAAP) has been prepared to enable effective gender mainstreaming under the BCIB Project.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Monitoring.There will be occupational health and safety (OHS) and road safety risks during construction and operations phase. Typical with any large infrastructure project, construction risks such as working at height, hazards from falling debris, working over water as well as numerous other typical risks will be present, whilst in the operational phase key risks will be present for maintenance staff working at height and working in the vicinity of roads. As part of the EIA, the EMP within contains templates to guide the contractor in forming an OHS Management Plan and Traffic Management Plan. These management plans should form a key part of the Contractor Environmental Management and Monitoring Action Plan (CEMMAP) which will detail the actions that the contractor has to follow to comply with international standard OHS requirements. In addition, during the project implementation, an independent third-party agency or consultants will be hired to proceed with the monitoring of ES performance. Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will prepare semi-annual ES monitoring reports for the Bank’s review. The Bank’s ES Specialists will carry out regular field-based ES monitoring missions together with ADB as part of the project implementation supervision mission.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). The BCIB Project has established a project-level GRM to receive and resolve project-related grievances in accordance with the requirements of ADB’s SPS. A GRM should be accessible and applicable to all members of the public and entities within the project's area of influence and can be expected to address their concerns and complaints. Locally appropriate public consultation and disclosure processes are used to disseminate information about the GRM. The information on the GRM and ADB’s independent accountability mechanism (IAM) is also included in the EIA, LARP, and other ES documents and disseminated to PAP. The EIA includes appropriate measures to manage the complaints raised by workers. Complaints raised by workers will be handled by this project GRM.",,Category A,OK

Appraisal mission has confirmed that ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) applies to the assessment of environmental and social (ES) impacts of project activities. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) also applies as road improvement and limited amount of widening are expected to generate economic displacement and minimum physical displacement of title and non-titleholders. More than a third of the population of Manipur state is categorized as Scheduled Tribes and they are present in Imphal city and are likely to be impacted by the Project. Therefore, ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is applicable. Because of those, the risks classification of the Project is Category B.Environmental and Social Instruments.To manage ES impacts and in accordance with relevant policies and regulation of the Government of India, Government of Manipur and the AIIB’s ESP, the Project carried out Initial Environment Examination (IEE) and prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF). The IEE and frameworks helped in conducting environmental and social impact assessment and preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a Resettlement Plan (RP), and an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) as ES instruments. The IEE, EMP, RP and IPP have been finalized and disclosed in-country. The contractor of the project shall also prepare the Site-Specific Contractor’s Environmental Social Management Plan (SSCESMP) as per the requirement in the EMP and Bidding Document, before its mobilization in Q1 2025. The preparation of SSCESMP and its review and clearance process has been included in the ES Action Plan (ESAP).Environmental Aspect.These activities' adverse impacts on the environment are limited to the immediate vicinity of the road alignment. Dust, vibration, noise, construction waste and earth material disposal, tree feelings, water contamination and siltation from the work at riverbank side roads (RSR) to rivers, ponds, community health and safety issues will be among the typical environmental impacts associated with the Project. The DPR consultant has undertaken baseline-environmental sampling program including ambient air quality monitoring, noise monitoring, ground water testing, surface water testing, soil quality testing, micro meteorological monitoring, air pollution modelling, noise quality modelling, ecological study, and avenue trees survey. In addition, since the project activities are on the existing roads and not within proximity to any protected areas or critical natural habitats, the Project will not cause habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, invasive species, or overexploitation as per the IEE and AIIB’s ESP.  The contractor is required to prepare a SSCESMP as per the requirement in EMP to get no-objection from the Construction Supervision Consultant and PWD, which will include more details of impact assessment and the proposed mitigation measures.Social Aspect.As per the environmental social assessment carried out by the Project in the IEE, RPF, a total of 22.8 hectares of land will be required for the purpose of road widening (where possible) and improvement of which 19.05 hectares is private land. The Project is impacting 4,843 households that includes 4,442 titleholders. Among the affected households, 704 are either socially and/or economically vulnerable. The impacts are partial, and no households will be physically relocated. An analysis of alternative was carried out to minimize adverse impacts. As a result of analysis of alternatives, total affected households have come down to 4,843 from originally estimated at 15,193. Similarly, land requirement has been reduced to 19 hectares from 78 hectares. Private land required for the Project will be directly purchased on a willing seller-willing buyer basis. A resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared in accordance with ESS 2 to minimize and mitigate impacts on the community and individuals. The RP includes quantification of impacts, mitigation measures, labor management plan, stakeholder engagement plan, institutional arrangement for implementation of RP and resettlement budget.Gender and Indigenous Peoples (IP). A Gender Action Plan (GAP) is prepared to promote gender inclusive design and implementation of the Project. The socioeconomic survey conducted as part of preparing the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) has identified 63 tribal households belonging to the Kubai and Naga Tribal community that will be impacted by the Project. As part of IPP preparation, the project team has conducted several free, prior informed consultations with Scheduled Tribe community to better understand the concerns and aspirations of the communities. In the process, the Project has obtained broad support of the affected tribal households. Manipur PWD along with the DPR consultants met the affected tribal households and explained about the Project and adverse impact the project will have on their land. An IPP has been prepared in accordance with laws and regulations of the Government of India, State Government of Manipur and AIIB’s ESS 3. The plan provides information about the socio-economic characteristics of the tribal community, impact of the Project and management measures to mitigate the adverse impacts; community level requirements; institutional arrangement for implementation and budget.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions:There will be OHS risks during road rehabilitation works and operation phases of the Project. Typical with any infrastructure project, construction risks such as working with heavy equipment and machineries, hazards from excavation works and falling debris, accident during transportation, working with asphalt and other heat sources, electricity and other typical risks will be present, whilst in the operational phase key risks will be present for maintenance staff working in the vicinity of roads, etc. The EMP contains annexes to guide the contractor in forming an OHS Management Plan, Community Heath Safety and Traffic Management Plan. These managements plans will form a key part of the SSCESMP as required in the Tender Document. The content of the SSCESMP and the respective OHS management plans will be checked by the ES team at EAP PWD Manipur and the Bank for quality assurance. Labour and employment condition including labour influx risks have also been assessed in the Labour Management Plan (LMP).Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Stakeholder engagement through public consultation and communication and focus group discussion have been carried out with various groups of stakeholders including women and vulnerable groups as part of the preparation of the ES documents and will be carried out throughout the project cycle. The findings of community consultation have been incorporated in the project design and ES risk management instruments such as EMP and the SSCESMP. The mechanism to engage stakeholders during the project implementation has been described in RP that includes issues to be discussed, frequency and form of engagement.

The improvements involve the renovation of suburban rail entry/exit areas, the construction of additional Foot-Over-Bridges (FOB) connecting the platforms, skywalks, and deck level connecting FOBs for better passenger circulation, the construction of additional ticket offices and toilets, the widening of platforms, additional staircases, escalators and lifts, and parking lots for two-wheelers. In addition, the works include the development of gender-responsive facilities and facilities for People with Disabilities (PwD). The relocation of the office area at the stations and general electrification works are also included. The new constructed features follow Indian Green Building Committee (IGBC) station building standards.Component B of the Project provides capacity building and preparation support, as well as finance technical studies.","Applicable Environmental and Social Policy.The Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy 2022 (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List, applies to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) will be triggered due to the identified rehabilitation impacts and potential additional land requirements for the project. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not be applicable to the Project as the project-affected area is highly urbanized and does not contain distinct social and cultural group(s) possessing the distinct characteristics as per ESS 3.Categorization and Instruments.The components of the Project have been screened and reviewed in accordance with the ESP and ESSs and re-classified as Category B, given the limited and localized construction stage environmental and social (E&S) impacts. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were prepared as per Bank’s ESP and disclosed in English including summaries of ESIA/ESMP and RAP in Marathi by MRVC and the Bank in March 2022.Environmental Aspects.The potential environmental impacts of the Project are site-specific and reversible construction stage impacts including air and water pollution, noise pollution, and disposal of construction and demolition wastes which were assessed in the ESIA. The assessment confirmed no impact on historical and cultural monuments. The assessment confirmed no impact on Historical and Cultural Monuments. For any chance finds during excavation, relevant national policies will be followed. The ESMP provides mitigation measures including institutional arrangements, schedule and budget for the implementation and its monitoring. The ESMP also includes mitigation plans, measures and provisions related to occupational health and safety, construction site management, and traffic and public utility management, among others. Additional wastewater and solid wastes on account of improved facilities will be managed by WR and CR during the operational phase.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.The Project design considers climate change effects of anticipated continuous increases in ambient temperature, heavy precipitation events, sea-level rise, earthquakes, and tsunamis. The Mumbai Suburban Rail network is located along the periphery connecting with the center, thus causing rainwater to pass through outlets below railway tracks before entering the sea or creek. To limit the impact of a potential precipitation and temperature increase, MRVC has integrated climate change considerations into the design of the Project. The design of the station improvements includes: (i) use of large open spaces for unrestricted air movement, cross-ventilation, and ensuring that enclosed areas are well-ventilated to improve adaptability to seasonal thermal variations in the stations; (ii) provision of shading to all platforms, decks, FOBs, and skywalks to prevent passengers from high temperature and rainfalls; (iii) provision of roof shading of light color with high Solar Reflective Index (SRI) value to reflect most of the solar energy and keep the underneath cool; (iv) design dimensioning to withstand expansion and contraction forces due to changes in temperature of the materials of the structure; and (v) use of steel structure with reinforced concrete foundation as the structural type for the FOBs, decks, and skywalks. The steel structure has the advantage of flexibility and endurance to bear required loads and the coating of the steel structure is selected to have the ability to get wet and then dry out with minimal damage. Therefore, the Project will contribute to building resilience to climate-induced shocks such as floods and increased temperatures.Social Aspects.The station improvement works require 15.8 ha of land, 1.01 percent of this land is government land the remaining land belongs to the railway authority. No private land is assessed to be acquired. Efforts were made by the design to avoid private land acquisition and to utilize existing railway land for the Project. There are a total of 9 structures affected, including 5 commercial structures in Chembur station and 4 residential structures in Mumbai Central and 18 Project-affected persons (PAPs) are identified at these two stations. A RAP including a summary is prepared and disclosed in accordance with the MRVC RPF for addressing these limited impacts.Gender and Inclusion Aspects.The Project will increase the ease and safety of travel of women and PwD commuters and thereby, increase access to markets, employment, education, and health services. The potential impact of the AIIB-supported components on women in the community has been assessed in the ESIA, and MRVC has prepared a Gender Action Plan (GAP) for the entire MUTP3A Program. Based on the recommendations from the stakeholder engagement, detailed station designs have been incorporated. MRVC engaged an experienced consultant to strengthen the station improvement measures in the areas of inclusion and accessibility based on international experiences. As part of the ESIA, the potential impact on women during construction was assessed, and mitigation measures are identified in ESMP and RAP, including non-discriminating in wage payment for construction work; measures to ensure the safety and health of female workers; the gender-based violence and prevention plan.Project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism.The existing GRM for addressing project-related grievances for MUTP 3 (P000228) established in accordance with the requirements of Bank’s ESP will be applicable for this Project as well. The GRM includes a procedure to receive and facilitate the resolution of Project-affected peoples’ and project contracted workers’ concerns, complaints, and grievances. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by the Project will be able to submit complaints and concerns to the Project-level GRM. The due diligence and field missions confirm the functioning and performance of the GRM.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Monitoring. MRVC has conducted several public consultations with project-affected people (PAPs), focus group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews/discussions in Mumbai stations. It involved different stakeholders including shop owners, informal settlers, daily passengers, students, and others. Major findings include issues related to trespassing, noise and vibration, employment of female security guards, resettlement logistics, and others. The project design benefited from these inputs. The E&S instruments are disclosed onAIIB websiteand theMRVC website. Considering this is a Category B project, as agreed with the PMO, project E&S matters, including ESMP implementation, will be monitored by the MRVC. The MRVC will prepare a biannual E&S monitoring report based on agreed format and report to the Bank. AIIB will conduct onsite implementation support missions regularly.",,Category B,OK

Funds will be released upon approved verification and submission of withdrawal applications, ensuring accountability and alignment with project objectives.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.The Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) will be applicable to this RBP. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project is proposed as Category B, considering that (i) Category A activities and other activities, that are likely to have significant adverse impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented on the environment and/or Project-affected people (PAPs), will be excluded from the RBP; and (ii) the environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts of the activities within the scope of this RBP are generally temporary, short-term, localized, and can be effectively avoided, reduced or mitigated through adopting mature civil work techniques and good management practice.Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA).The ESSA conducted by the Bank developed exclusion criteria to ensure the exclusion of Category A activities and those with significant adverse impacts on the environment and affected people. The ESSA assessed the Borrower’s ES management system (ESMS) in place to manage all identified ES impacts, focused on the main elements of applicable Borrower systems, and provided an analysis of the acceptability of these systems, and the extent to which the Borrower’s systems and practices are aligned with core principles and elements outlined in the Bank’s ESP. The ESSA covered a detailed analysis of the legal framework, institutional capacity, and operational systems used by the Borrower in project planning, implementation, and monitoring. The ESSA concludes that the Borrower has the foundational systems and regulations necessary to manage ES risks likely to be encountered in this RBP but requires improvements both content-wise as well as in the application of the corporate ESMS for effective implementation of the RBP, especially at the field level. The ESSA recommends actions to strengthen the Borrower’s overall ES management capacity, enabling it to effectively mitigate risks and improve Project outcomes in line with good international practice standards.Environmental and Social Aspects.The Project will generate ES benefits by enhancing electricity access, reliability, and transmission efficiency in the regions. Key potential ES risks and impacts of this RBP are related to the construction and operation of new and/or upgraded distribution lines, substations and the solar photovoltaic (PV) plus battery energy storage system (BESS). The construction stage related impacts may include small scale permanent and/or temporary land acquisition and/or physical and/or economic displacement; site generation of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes; soil erosion and sediment control; fugitive dust and other emissions; noise and vibration impacts; potential for hazardous materials and oil spills; habitat loss and fragmentation, and removal of vegetation; occupational and community health and safety risks; and exclusion of vulnerable groups. During operation and maintenance phases, there will be disturbance to communities and wildlife; risk to birds, primates and bats through collisions and electrocutions; electric magnetic fields (EMF) impacts; water consumption for solar panel cleaning and wastewater generation; fire and explosion risks associated with BESS; disposal of hazardous wastes including end-of-life solar panels and batteries.Gender Aspects:The Project aims to enhance gender equality and address the specific needs of women and vulnerable groups through several measures. Improved electricity access in underserved areas will benefit women by providing better opportunities for education, healthcare, and economic activities. The Project will create job opportunities and promote skill development, ensuring equitable access for women. Effective stakeholder engagement will actively involve women and vulnerable groups, addressing barriers to participation. ES management measures will be implemented to prevent and mitigate Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Harassment (SEASH). Gender-sensitive training and capacity-building programs for PLN staff will be conducted, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating gender impacts will be established.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure.During the ESSA preparation, key stakeholders have been identified and consulted, mainly including PLN staff, community stakeholders, landowners, vulnerable groups, village officers, and the contractors, and the ESSA has been revised to respond to the comments received. The ESSA report in English and summary in Bahasa Indonesia was disclosed on AIIB’s website on February 19, 2025.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The Borrower has established a comprehensive contact center accessible to the public through multiple channels. Furthermore, the Borrower has developed an ESMS manual, which includes guidelines for implementing a GRM within the organization. This manual serves as a foundational document, outlining procedures for addressing grievances and ensuring that community concerns are effectively managed. Although the current GRM is not specifically tailored to the Project, the existing contact center and the ESMS manual provide a framework for handling complaints and facilitating communication between the Borrower and stakeholders.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is triggered given the nature of the proposed Project activities. Since the Project will be constructed using existing structures/buildings, ESS2 Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement are not applicable. In addition, the Project components are mainly within urban areas of the Guangzhou Municipality, where no ethnic minority groups are collectively attached to the Project areas. Therefore, ESS 3 Indigenous Peoples is not triggered. The Project is proposed as a Category B, considering the lack of land acquisition and limited scale of civil work, as well as the expectation that the Project’s environmental and social (E&S) impacts will be manageable through mitigation measures and management tools.Environmental and Social Instruments.As a Category B Project, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) have been prepared to cover the entire Project in accordance with AIIB’s ESP. ESIA including ESMP documentation was disclosed both in English and Chinese by the Client in an appropriate manner and on AIIB’s website.Environmental Aspects.The ESIA/ESMP prepared covers the following aspects based on the digital infrastructure nature of the project and taking into account that major project activities/construction will be undertaken in existing buildings/structures for device/equipment installation and interior decoration, including: (i) clear baseline information on what will be impacted and modified due to Project activities; (ii) impact assessment focusing on construction and operational phases, including occupational health and safety matters; (iii) provision of recommendations on measures to implement to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts; (iv) stakeholder engagement, especially with project affected peoples (PAPs) who were identified during the preparation of the ESIA/ESMP, including information and GRM disclosure in a meaningful manner throughout Project cycle; and (v) institutional arrangements for E&S management and monitoring during preparation and implementation.Social Aspects.The proposed Project’s social impacts and risks should not be significant and the Project does not involve any land acquisition. Land use and property ownership due diligence was conducted and concluded that the previous land acquisition and resettlement have no legacy issues. As per the ESP requirements, a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) has been conducted within the ESIA process to consider vulnerable groups, community safety, gender-based violence (GBV), labor influx and labor conditions, traffic safety and stakeholder engagement. The SIA was used to enhance the Project's design by considering the inclusion of gender opportunities and promoting women's socioeconomic empowerment. Actions planned in ESIA/ESMP to address the health and safety concerns for communities and workers matters including preventing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment. In addition, compliance with the ESMP is an essential part of the contract document with contractors.Gender Aspects.Implementation of the Project should increase employment opportunities for women. During project preparation, a gender analysis identified gaps and prepared a Gender Action Plan (GAP) as part of the ESMP for this Project aiming to cover GBV, gender inclusion, and institutional capacity building.

ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management), ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement), and ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples (IP) are triggered by the Project. Considering the scale of investment, an ES Category A is proposed for the Project. This category reflects the significant environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts expected due to the pipelines that will pass through ES sensitive sites, including Jinjiehao, a National Cultural Heritage Site, and the Luan River National Wetland Park. Furthermore, impacts related to permanent and temporary land acquisition and occupation, potential economic displacements, and occupational health and safety, are anticipated.Environmental and Social Instruments.In line with the requirement of Bank’s ESP, an ES impact assessment (ESIA) and ES management plan (ESMP) were prepared to address Project related ES issues. ESIA/ESMP analyze the ES impacts and risks from the design, construction, and operational phases of the Project, comparing them with those of feasible alternatives (including the “without Project” scenario), and recommend the mitigation measures needed to avoid, minimize, or compensate for adverse impacts and to improve the ES performance of the Project. To address the issues of land acquisition and economic displacement, a Resettlement Plan (RP) was prepared to govern involuntary resettlement of a temporary or permanent nature. The RP includes an Entitlement Matrix, estimated resettlement budget and resettlement implementation schedule. An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was also prepared as the Project triggers ESS3.Environment Aspects.The Project activities span across several cities, counties, and banners in Inner Mongolia, encompassing arid and semi-arid areas considered fragile and sensitive ecosystems. Environmental due diligence identified key environmental issues, impacts, and risks based on the locations of proposed Project activities and their environmental characteristics. Based on the impact assessments, mitigation measures and their implementation arrangements – including management, monitoring, and reporting – have been outlined in the ESIA and ESMP. Thus far, no associated facilities have been identified during the ESIA due diligence process, and no endangered species and the subjects with critical biodiversity significance have been found in the Project areas. In addition, according to the Project’s feasibility study and site inspection, two pipelines will pass through environmentally sensitive sites, including the Luan River National Wetland Park in the west section of Ulanqab Huade – Xilinguole Duolun Pipeline, and Jinjiehao, a national cultural heritage site located in the west section of Chahar-Front-Right Banner – Huade County Pipeline. To minimize the environmental impacts, such as soil erosion, water pollution, and impacts to eco-system and biological diversity in the wetland and rivers, directional horizontal drilling, as a mature technology in the construction market, has been recommended for use in the construction. During ESIA process, local governmental agencies, e.g., ecology and environment department, natural resource and land bureau, forest and grassland management bureau, etc., have been consulted to seek their views on the pipeline routes, to ensure relevant national policies and regulations are complied with, such as Wetland Conservation Law (issued in 2022). Permits for construction will be issued by above mentioned relevant bureaus, based on the review and clearance of the Project design.Social Aspects.The Project is expected to generate positive social benefits for residents in Inner Mongolia but also a substantial community interface and potential risks and impacts. Social risks and impacts may include (i) livelihood impacts from economic displacement due to permanent or temporary land acquisition, (ii) impacts on ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups, (iii) community health and safety risks, and (iv) occupational health and safety risks of project workers, among others. In addition, the Project is expected to involve a limited amount of permanent land acquisition in some resettlement impacts and a substantial amount of temporary land occupation due to the installation of gas pipelines and the construction of valve stations. However, housing will not be affected. An RP complying with ESS2 and applicable laws and regulations in China was prepared and will be endorsed by the government before construction activities start. Due diligence has confirmed that no unresolved legacy issues remain.Indigenous Peoples and Gender Aspect.It is estimated that the Project will directly affect about 1,113 ethnic minority (EM) people in 75 villages, most of Mongolian ethnicity. Five villages with more than 10% of EM people and 17 villages with more than 5% EM people will be affected by permanent land acquisition or temporary land occupation. Therefore, an IPP was prepared setting forth measures to ensure that EM villages and people can fully benefit from the Project in a culturally appropriate manner and that special measures are taken to avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts. As part of ESIA preparation, the Client has collected gender related data, and analysis and assessment have been conducted in gender-disaggregated manner to identify the specific practices, needs, and issues of women. A gender action plan (GAP), which is part of ESMP, has been prepared to ensure women’s opinions and concerns will be integrated into Project design and implementation to promote the gender equality in the Project.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor, and Employment Conditions.The Project construction involves a large amount of engineering and complex construction operations, including earthwork excavation, pipeline crossing cultural heritage site, rivers, wetland, and railway/highway using directional drilling and pipe-jacking. The construction machinery used in the construction process of the Project will pose a potential risk to the workers’ safety if the workers use them improperly. During transportation of construction materials, traffic accidents would result in injury or fatal accidents of workers. A set of preventive and mitigation measures have been proposed in the ESMP. In addition, as the Project involves construction of a solar PV facility, the ESIA/ESMP outlines essential measures to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social, and environmental risks and impacts. Due diligence was conducted to identify potential risks related to labor and working conditions in the solar PV supply chain, focusing on assessing the supply chain approach and the client’s ability to address these risks. The client developed a supply chain management plan, which includes ways to enhance the client’s leverage over its suppliers and minimize risks. Additionally, all suppliers and contractors will be required to implement appropriate management measures to address issues related to the environmental and social provisions of the ESIA/ESMP, including labor and working conditions and health and safety matters. Compliance with the ESIA/ESMP is a crucial part of the contract documents with suppliers and contractors. This compliance, along with representations and warranties to be provided by suppliers and contractors, will be reflected in relevant agreements and contracts.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The Project Implementing Entity (PIE) carried out meaningful consultations with various categories of stakeholders during the preparation of the ES instruments, including the ESIA, ESMP, RP and IPP, to make sure that the Project-affected people (PAP) are aware of the Project activities, including impacts and mitigation measures. The Project’s stakeholder engagement process included stakeholder analysis and engagement planning, disclosure of information and consultation, and participation in a culturally appropriate manner. A Stakeholder Engagement Program (SEP) as part of ESIA has been developed to support consultation and communication throughout the Project cycle. ES documents will be disclosed on the PIE’s website in Chinese and English, as well as summaries of these documents in Mongolian language. AIIB will also disclose these documents on its website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A multi-tier GRM has been established to handle complaints and concerns related to the Project in the ESMP, RP and IPP, and will be kept functional throughout the Project implementation. The PMO is responsible for managing the overall grievance process and coordinating with the government departments, and the Client will handle daily complaints and provide feedback in a timely manner. Information about the GRM has been shared through public consultations that have been conducted. A separate GRM will handle workplace complaints. The information of the GRM including AIIB’s Project-affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed to the affected villages in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.ESMP implementation is Western Gas’s obligation and responsibility. Based on the information provided in ESIA, Western Gas’ internal ESMS has proper capacity for handling ES matters during their operation. Additionally, the third-party ES monitoring will be engaged to monitor and report the ES performance periodically. The ES management and monitoring will be conducted with the reports prepared by the client based on agreed format during project implementation. The semi-annual ES management and monitoring report will be provided to the Bank for review.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement and Land Acquisition) are applicable to this Project. Given the project activities, location, and potential risks, the Project is rated as Category A.Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) covering the sections of the Investment Program supported by ADB and EBRD has been prepared and disclosed by the parallel financiers. A Supplemental ESIA has been carried for the bridge and approach roads as an addendum to the ESIA already prepared. The Supplemental ESIA includes an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP).The Project will construct a long bridge to sustain connectivity of communities over the Rogun HPP reservoir being constructed. The HPP and its reservoir does not fit the definition of ‘associated facility’ (AF) under the ESP. The road sections financed by ADB and EBRD do not fall under the definition of AFs either, as these sections have been described as a single Investment Project in all project documents by financiers.Dust, water, vibration, noise, and solid waste will be among the typical environmental impacts associated with the bridge construction. Civils works within the river (i.e., foundations) will be carried out strictly during the dry season when there is no flow and prior to the headwaters of the Rogun dam reaching the project site. Should this change, it will reflect material change to the assessment, and the ESIA will be revised to the satisfaction of the Bank. During the operational stage, the major environmental risks include wildlife road accidents, induced hunting/collecting due to better access to the project area, and risk of water contamination due to potential traffic accidents on the proposed bridge. Occupational health and safety risks and impacts during construction and operations are associated with working at height, hazards from falling debris, working over water and in the vicinity of roads. A Climate Risk and Adaptation (CRA) Assessment has assessed the sensitivity, exposure, and vulnerability of the Project to relevant climate hazards. Relevant adaptation measures have been identified to address climate risks and enhance climate resilience. Robust mitigation measures to address adverse impacts of the Project are included in the ESMP along with a monitoring plan. Finalized CRA will be disclosed on Bank’s website as part of revised ESIA.The Project is not anticipated to induce any physical or economic resettlement. Temporary land acquisition impacts are associated with workers’ camps and construction facilities. These impacts will be avoided and minimized by acquiring the state-owned and not used by communities’ lands, otherwise a land acquisition plan will be prepared and implemented. Other social impacts are likely to include access restrictions, community health and safety and risks associated with labour influx. These impacts will be addressed through the implementation of ESMP prepared for the Project.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure: A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared for this Project to ensure effective communication of the investment plans, potential impacts, and mitigation measures during project implementation. A Non-technical Summary (NTS) has also been prepared and translated into the local language.

ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) applies, ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) is currently being assessed, while and ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. The project has been classified as Category B following the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), as there are a number of limited potentially adverse impacts, these impacts are not unprecedented or irreversible and can be managed through implementation of international good practice.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) has been prepared in 2023 based on national regulations and requirements, and currently, consultants have been mobilized to prepare an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to supplement gaps in compliance to AIIB’s ESF, including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). Solar Park is being understood as an Associated Facility of the project that is located within the same land and is being built primarily to evacuate the power generated by Solar. An Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) will be undertaken to look at the possible risks and impacts of the proposed solar project. Further environmental and social (E&S) instruments will be identified and prepared as necessary according to the preliminary results of the ESIA.Environment Aspects.There are no protected areas within the alignment stretch, although the line is expected to traverse paddy fields, and some forest patches. Initial findings anticipated that the project will not result in a significant loss of flora species as they are neither unique nor restricted to the project area habitats and will not cause serious disruption of migratory routes for fauna species as construction will be limited to project area. Risks and impacts anticipated during construction are temporary for physical environment, i.e., water, ambient air, noise, soil pollution and generation of wastes including hazardous wastes. Impacts during operation include possible collision risks of mammals, birds and bats to the transmission towers and cables. The ESIA and ESMP will identify and address risks and impacts relating to the above through an ecological and critical habitat assessment.Social Aspects.The project will construct a substation and around 113 towers along a 38-km transmission line route. Land will be required for both the line corridor and setting up temporary workers camps, including from farmers that use land as a primary source of income. Livelihoods are likely to be not interrupted as the construction work is proposed to be undertaken during the off-season. The project has been designed to minimize the number of households affected by the project and will avoid the need for resettlement. Vulnerable groups, including seasonal labor, female-headed households, low-income households, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facing potential livelihood disruption and risks related to labor influx will be identified in the ESIA, and additional instruments prepared as needed. These will be reviewed by AIIB to ensure compliance with AIIB’s ESP and ESSs.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The health and safety risks to local communities are expected during the implementation phase given that construction will occur on land which is adjacent to schools, roads, and houses, and on farming land with heavy footfall during harvest season. Unskilled labor will be sourced from seasonal workers in local communities, but skilled labor is expected to be externally recruited, creating risks related to labor influx. There are also risks relating to occupational health and safety (OHS), as well as working conditions such as working at height, live power lines and lightning strike risks, hence workers are required with adequate PPE with H&S training and should be provided with compensation and reasonable living conditions. With this, the ESIA will elaborate further and prepare the necessary instruments to avoid and mitigate risks, including operational and community health and safety, traffic, child abuse and gender-based violence (GBV)/ sexual exploitation (SE)/ sexual harassment (SH), and labor and working conditions.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The key stakeholders include government, farmer organizations, and community members, including those from vulnerable and marginalized groups. Initial consultations identified a low awareness amongst community members around the development benefits of transmission lines, and concerns surrounding adverse health effects of the proposed infrastructure. Further consultations will be conducted to inform the preparation of the ESIA. Then, analysis of affected stakeholders and their vulnerabilities, and planning for meaningful engagement throughout the project cycle, including through awareness-raising campaigns, will be outlined in the ESIA. ES instruments prepared for the Project, including ESIA and ESMP, will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.Building on the existing complaint mechanisms of CEB, a two-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be constituted for the project in line with the Bank’s ESP. Communities and individuals who believe they are adversely affected by the project will be able to submit complaints to the project-level GRM for resolution. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for workers' grievances. The information of established GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed to the local communities and project-affected people in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.The Project Management Unit (PMU) of CEB will be fully responsible for monitoring the project's implementation and is expected to prepare progress reports semi-annually based on agreed format highlighting progress on the implementation of E&S plans. During implementation of the project, the Bank will conduct regular supervision missions to monitor progress. The frequency of the missions will depend on implementation progress and complexity. The Bank will also have virtual and in-person interactions with CEB and may engage the Bank's local consultants to conduct more frequent supervision, as required.",USD22 million,Category B,OK

AIIB's Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs), applies to this Project. With the arrangement involving the provision of funds through an FI, the Project has been placed in Category FI, whereby AIIB delegates to CBL the decision-making on the use of AIIB's funds in so far as the infrastructure sub-projects meet the conditions to be agreed upon with CBL. This includes the selection, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of sub-projects and oversight of the sub-borrowers and sub-projects in line with AIIB's ESP requirements. Coal mining, coal transportation, coal-fired power plants, and infrastructure services that inclusively support these activities and gas-related sub-projects or investments will be excluded.Environmental and Social Instruments.The environmental and social (E&S) instrument for this Project will be CBL's Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS), enhanced as required to comply with the AIIB's ESP. The Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) Policy of CBL currently serves as its ESMS (Guideline-on-Environmental-and-Social-Risk-Management.pdf), including the core procedure and implementation arrangement for its every transaction, lending activities, management processes, and other CBL operations. For AIIB on-lending, CBL has agreed to prepare an enhanced ESMS to define the process for E&S screening, categorization, appraisal, contracting and monitoring sub-loans supported by AIIB loan proceeds according to the ESP and specify the applicability of AIIB ESF for higher risk activities. The CBL's commitment to enhance its ESMS has been incorporated into an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) agreed upon by CBL, which will be part of the loan agreement. The enhanced ESMS will be submitted to AIIB for review and approval, and will be disclosed by the Client and AIIB before the first utilization of the loan proceeds by CBL.Environmental and Social Issues. The loan is expected to support sub-projects in multiple infrastructure sub-sectors, including renewable energy and digital infrastructure. The sub-projects potential E&S risks and impacts will be mostly from the construction activities and the operations, such as the impact on the sensitive E&S area, physical and economic displacement due to permanent or temporary land and/or right-of-way acquisition, health and safety, impacts from associated facilities and impacts on biodiversity and Indigenous communities, among others. Any of these may trigger Higher Risk categorization and prior review by AIIB. The review and clearance process by CBL and AIIB will be a condition precedent to using AIIB funds for CBL's initial disbursement to the sub-borrowers. CBL will be required to prepare an annual E&S performance report of its sub-projects for submission to AIIB based on the agreed format. In addition, prior review and consent of AIIB will be required for the first three sub-projects and all Category A sub-projects or other sub-projects that involve Higher Risk Activities before funds are allocated to these sub-projects. The categorization of the sub-projects will follow the principles set out in the enhanced ESMS for AIIB loan proceeds.Environmental and Social Capacity and Resources. CBL's ESRM Policy governs its E&S impact assessment and practices. It has an existing ESMS developed and enhanced over time through its collaboration with international financing institutions such as IFC, DEG, FMO, and the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF), among others. It has a dedicated sustainable finance committee and sustainable finance unit with trained staff at headquarters who retain responsibility for E&S assessment for transactions and established processes to integrate the findings of E&S assessment into the lending review process. The E&S team conducts regular training and development for new staff, relationship managers, risk managers, associated officials, and credit admin managers. Additionally, the MCDF grant will finance the enhancement of CBL's ESMS to ensure alignment with AIIB's ESP, given that financing infrastructure sub-projects is new to CBL. The Training Need Assessment and Capacity Building Plan are part of the capacity-building initiatives of the Project.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The sub-projects will conform with the OHS and labor laws and standards of Bangladesh and the enhanced ESMS. As agreed in the ESAP, for all solar power sub-projects, CBL will review the sub-borrowers' supply chain information and screen for potential adverse labor and working conditions involving their suppliers. AIIB's E&S specialists will closely monitor CBL's documentation of its due diligence for solar power sub-projects following the ESAP and the Project's legal agreement terms.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure. CBL is committed to fostering positive contributions to the community and its stakeholders. CBL publishes aSustainability Report, which provides information about the company's progress in ESG matters and its performance. To comply with the AIIB's ESP, CBL will disclose an overview of the standalone ESMS, specifically regarding the AIIB loan proceeds. Additionally, sub-borrowers will disclose their E&S instruments for Category A at least 60 calendar days before the final approval of the sub-project activity. CBL will continue to disclose its E&S performance on its website in a timely manner, as well as its Annual Sustainability Report.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The Project has an existing Complaint Management Cell managed by a selected compliance team to receive complaints and related reports/issues, which will be used as the Project GRM. The enhancement of ESMS will also include further enhancement of the GRM to ensure the system is functional. CBL will require its sub-borrowers to establish a functional sub-project-level GRM as early as possible and before the commencement of subproject activities. Information of established GRMs, including the Bank's Project-affected People's Mechanism (PPM) will be disclosed timely in both English and Bangla, and in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangement.CBL has a dedicated E&S Manager and Risk Management (RM) staff who conduct E&S risk monitoring visits. The results of these visits are documented in the monitoring report, which CBL uses to follow up with sub-borrowers. A similar arrangement will be incorporated into the standalone ESMS for AIIB loan proceeds, with the possibility of conducting more frequent monitoring visits and reporting for higher risk activities based on the agreed format. In addition, AIIB specialists will undertake regular implementation support missions twice a year as part of E&S capacity support to CBL, especially for the review and clearance of infrastructure sub-projects E&S documents, as stipulated in the ESAP.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable to the ES aspects of the Project. Category A is assigned as the Project will have significant environmental and social (ES) impacts during both construction and operation phases. Asian Development Bank (ADB) is considering participating in the financing as a senior lender (project finance) and they have categorized as A for environment and B for involuntary resettlement.Environmental and Social Instruments.For the Kungrad wind farm, an Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) along with a Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) has been prepared in line with ADB’s requirement and disclosed on ADB’s website. The ESIA also includes broad Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), which summarizes the impacts identified as well as the mitigation measures and monitoring requirements to be implemented throughout the Project cycle. In addition, ESMP also describes the institutional framework and procedural arrangement for the implementation including Environment, Social, Health and Safety (ESHS) Management System. Considering the overhead transmission line (OHTL) will affect approximately 203 farmers and potentially cause economic displacement for 5 households, a Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) will be developed and implemented before the first disbursement. The Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) of ACWA Power will be reviewed and enhanced if required to ensure alignment with AIIB’s ESP. This includes reviewing how ACWA Power manages ES risks across its portfolio of projects, including its policies, procedures, monitoring practices, and track record in managing ES issues. This will be added as a condition precedent prior to effectiveness.Environmental Aspects.The Project poses significant risks of adverse impacts on biodiversity throughout its various phases, especially during construction and operational activities. These include habitat destruction, fragmentation, and disturbance, particularly to species identified as vulnerable or endangered. The construction phase will include risks related to land clearing, habitat fragmentation, and the establishment of overhead transmission lines and access roads, which could act as barriers to migratory species and disrupt established ecological patterns. During the operational phase, the most significant adverse impacts may involve collisions of migratory birds with wind turbine blades and transmission lines. CHA for the Project has been carried out which has identified the risks and recommended mitigation measures on potential impacts on critical habitats including preparation of a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). In addition, the ESIAs assess these cumulative impacts by considering the combined effect of projects in the region, identifying critical thresholds. The ESMP includes mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the cumulative impacts, such as strategic placement of turbines and creating alternative habitats.Social Aspects.The wind farm will not result in any adverse social impact. A total of 4,600 square km of area has been identified that is free of encroachment and other encumbrances. The nearest settlement is Krikhiz town which is 110 km away from the site. The Project will bring in positive impact for the region by providing over 2,200 job opportunities at peak during the construction phase for a duration of approximately 42 months. During operational stage, approximately 80 job opportunities for a duration of 20-25 years will be generated. The approximately 800 km of OHTL however, will lead to permanent acquisition of 0.29 square km of private agriculture land for tower footings. There will be additional restrictive use of land under the ROW which approximately comes to 31.66 square km. This will adversely impact 203 formal farmers with land leases and estimated 20 informal farmers. There could be potential physical displacement of 5 households losing structures primarily used for economic purposes. There are additional Project components that will be required on a temporary basis throughout the construction phase of the Project. The location of these facilities (laydown areas for temporary storage area, batching plant, and worker camp area) will be identified once the EPC Contractor is appointed and a detailed design is completed. The requirements for temporary components will be included in the ESMS to be considered by the EPC Contractor when planning for such components.Gender Aspects:As part of ESIA, gender assessment was carried out that included gender consultations in line with Gender and Development Policy (1998) of ADB. Since project will have large influx of migrant laborers during the construction period, the ESIA specifically looked into the issues related to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH). Mitigation measures includes (i) Worker Grievance Mechanism to prohibit gender-based violence and harassment in the workplace; (ii) separate accommodation for women as well as separate sanitary, toilet facilities, and prayer rooms; (iii) all women facilities will have lockable doors with adequate numbers provided; (iv) separate changing rooms and cabinets for men and women; (v) all workers will be required to read and sign a Worker Code of Conduct which will be explained verbally.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Working Conditions.The mitigation of community health and safety risks will be defined in the Occupational Health, and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP) to be prepared at the start of the construction and operational phases. This will cover labor and working conditions of contractors and sub-contractors and management of communicable diseases. The Project will develop a Worker Influx Management Plan to manage the potential risks associated with worker influx in the Project area. In addition, the EPC Contractor and O&M provider will prepare a SEA/SH Prevention and Response Action Plan, Human Resources Policy (and related procedures), Retrenchment Plan and Human Rights Policy.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement was carried out as part of the ESIA process and in accordance with the regulatory requirements in Uzbekistan and the international ES standards and requirements. Stakeholder consultations and engagement included national government entities, regional and local governmental entities, NGOs/CSOs, and local communities. Consultations mainly included public disclosure of project components, probable impacts, findings and recommendations proposed in the ESIA. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for future stakeholder engagement and consultations process has also been designed for the construction and operational stage of the project. SEP describes the planned stakeholder consultation activities and engagement process to take place after the ESIA approval. The English version of the ES instruments and relevant translations in the local language will be timely disclosed online and made available in the project area. In addition, the ES documents will be posted on the Bank’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Although the Project Company will remain responsible and accountable and will likely maintain presence on site during construction and commissioning, the EPC Contractor will establish a project-level GRM to manage internal and external grievances. A member of staff will be assigned the responsibility to receive and follow up on all grievances. Grievances will be investigated by the EPC Contractor and may require co-ordination with the project company or other sub-contractors. This designated staff member will be responsible for following up and managing grievances. The project-level GRM will be finalized by the EPC Contractor once the design is finalized. The information of established GRM and AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements for the Project are listed in the Project’s ESMP for the planning phase, construction phase and for the operation phase. The proposed monitoring plan clearly defines monitoring and reporting requirements, parameters to be monitored, the locations, suggested frequency and assigns a responsible entity for each activity.

In the medium term by 2030, the Project is expected to attract over 600,000 tons of international air freight and to facilitate the cross-border trading activities.Leveraging on the proximity of the park to the Airport, the Project aims to incubate new aviation-related business which will include bonded maintenance and repair, cross-border e-commerce, international cold-chain storage and shipping. Overall, the Project will support the development of Ezhou as a global air freight hub and main gateway for opening-up Hubei and central China.","AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) apply to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable to the Project. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable, as per the Bank’s ESP, due to no indigenous people or ethnic minority groups are collectively attached to the project area.The Project has been categorized as Category A, considering the significant land acquisition and potential noise cumulative impacts during operation. The Project is located in a habitat substantially modified by human activities and is unlikely to cause significant adverse impacts to biodiversity. Its adverse environmental impacts include general construction nuisance and occupational health and safety risks; operation-related exhaust gases, wastes, machinery and traffic noise, dangerous and hazardous goods and chemicals management, and communicable disease transmission.The environmental and social (E&S) instruments to be prepared prior to appraisal review will include: an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), including a Gender Action Plan (GAP), and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP). The E&S instruments will also review any outstanding legacy issues through Land Use Due Diligence (LUDD). Additional land acquired for the Project and potential Associated Facilities will be evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures to restore and/or improve the livelihoods of Project-affected People (PAP) will be proposed through a separate Resettlement Plan (RP). E&S documentation of the Project both in English and Chinese will be timely disclosed by the client in an appropriate manner. AIIB will also disclose those E&S documentation from its website timely.The local resident will benefit from possible job opportunities directly and indirectly during construction and operation of the Project including those small and medium scale businesses within and outside the project area. Risks for the Project are associated with construction and operation include impacts on social disturbance due to dust, noise, and vibration; occupational health and safety (OHS); labor influx, risk of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH); community health and safety; and land acquisition.The Project will occupy 95 ha of land area, of which 28 ha of land area was acquired, and compensation and relocation of affected households was completed from 2017-2022. An additional 67 ha of collective land areas need to be acquired without any required relocation of households, of which, around 29 ha is cultivated land. Thus, a separate RP will be prepared for the land acquisition and resettlement to restore and/or improve the livelihoods of the Project-affected Peoples (PAPs). In addition, the ESIA will analyze the Project’s impacts on women and identified vulnerable groups and aim to explore avenues through which women’s participation can be enhanced. The Project will request contractors to include a minimum quota of female workers aimed at encouraging women in taking employment opportunities for civil works contracts and during operation of the facility.Stakeholder engagement through public consultation and communication and Focus Group Discussion will be carried out with various groups of stakeholders including PAPs, women and identified vulnerable groups as part of the preparation of E&S documents and continued throughout the project cycle. The stakeholder engagement aims to meaningfully and in a culturally appropriate manner engage with PAPs and local communities, disseminate information about the Project, impacts, grievance mechanism and mitigation measures and obtain feedback and suggestion on design related issues and mitigation measures. In addition, more detailed arrangement of monitoring and reporting will be determined during the Project Appraisal.A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be established at the Project level to receive and facilitate resolution of the concerns or complaints of the people who believe they have been or are likely to be adversely affected by E&S impacts of the Project. A commensurate mechanism will be made available for raising workplace grievances. AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be used for the Project. The information of established GRM and Bank’s PPM both in English and Chinese will be disclosed timely to the local communities and PAPs in an appropriate manner.",,Category A,OK

According to the Northeast Regional Climate Change Assessment Report - 2020 Policymaker Summary, extreme climate events and hazardous weather disasters strike the region more frequently. Therefore, it became an urgent task for Panjin City to build up its urban climate resilience.The Project aims to support the Panjin City addressing various challenges related to frequent urban flooding, caused primarily by urban drainage blockages, and river affluent water quality and related pollution, caused by combined effects of rainwater and wastewater, especially in the context of increased climate change pressures. To achieve the Project objective, the following four pillars, or components, around which technical interventions will be put in place, are proposed and designed:Component 1: Wetland Restoration and Conservation. This component includes rehabilitation of ecological corridors in the urban area, and reconnection of the fragmented wetland and river systems.Component 2: Sponge City Infrastructure Transformation. This component includes expansion and upgrading of urban drainage systems and pumping stations, as well as separation of urban stormwater system from the sewerage system. Given that the Panjin city is a coastal city with high groundwater level, complex river systems and vulnerability to rising sea level caused by climate change, its sponge city transformation needs special design and consideration.Component 3: Digitalization of Urban Drainage Management System. This component will build up City Information Modelling (CIM) and a digitalized system, enabling the smart management of urban drainage network, pumping stations, wastewater plants and associated facilities.Component 4: Capacity Building. This component will provide project management support to the Panjin city during project implementation, and it will also support the Environmental and Social monitoring.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), applies to the Project. Based on the proposed project activities and the feasibility report, ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable to the proposed Project. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not be applicable to the Project as the Project-affected area does not contain distinct social and cultural group(s) possessing the distinct characteristics as per ESS 3. Given the nature and scope, Category A is proposed for the Project because of land acquisition leading to physical and economic displacement and environmental impacts that are unprecedent and irreversible.Environmental and Social Instruments.To manage Environmental and Social (E&S) risks and impacts, the Project will conduct Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and prepare Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Resettlement Plan (RP). Other documents that will be prepared and disclosed include Gender Action Plan (GAP), Labor Management Plan (LMP) and Stakeholders Engagement Plan (SEP). All these documents will be disclosed both locally and on AIIB’s website. The Project has hired consultants for conducting ESIA and other E&S documents.Environment Aspects.Panjin has a unique landscape (reed fields and red beach) and river systems, including estuary of the Liao River (downstream from the city’s core areas); these wetlands that has been classified as a national level nature reserve and are internationally recognized by a number of conventions. The proposed project activities are not conducted in the environmentally sensitive areas, but mainly in modified environments, e.g., in urban or suburbs of urban districts. Nevertheless, a biodiversity baseline survey in the project area of influence will be conducted as part of ESIA, and if needed, a specific biodiversity management plan (BMP) may also be prepared. Environmental impacts during construction on the proposed components are expected, e.g., air pollution, dust, noise, water and solid waste pollutions, interruption to traffic and communities, and possible dredging activity. Therefore, E&S impact/risk assessment should be done with a set of mitigation measures and adequate implementation arrangements.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project presents key social risks and impacts, particularly related to physical and economic displacement arising from the acquisition of collectively owned land for real estate development purposes and the occupation of state-owned land. The Project will result in economic displacement for 46 owners of commercial structures in a local village, as well as for nine households located on a state-owned farm. Additionally, 26 households will experience physical displacement. Temporary land occupation will also affect two households. To address these risks and mitigate potential impacts, a RP is currently being finalized to comply with ESS2 and applicable laws and regulations in China. ESIA will also assess potential gender-related issues within the Project area. Additionally, the Project’s grievance mechanism will be gender-sensitive, with systems in place to collect and analyze gender-disaggregated data on complaints received and resolved.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.Meaningful consultations with a broad spectrum of stakeholders will be conducted throughout the preparation of the E&S instruments. The Project’s stakeholder engagement process will be designed to include comprehensive stakeholder analysis and engagement planning, effective information disclosure, and consultation, with an emphasis on culturally appropriate participation. Accordingly, a SEP will be developed to support consultation and communication throughout the Project cycle systematically. All E&S instruments, including ESIA, ESMP and RP, will be timely disclosed by the client and the Bank in an appropriate manner in line with established disclosure standards.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism and Monitoring.A Project-specific Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be developed, clearly communicated, and made easily accessible to all stakeholders, enabling the receipt, acknowledgment, evaluation, and resolution of complaints related to E&S concerns. Records of grievances received, corrective actions taken, and the outcomes of such actions will be appropriately maintained. The GRM, including information on the Project-Affected People’s Mechanism (PPM), will be disclosed in Chinese to the communities and Project-Affected People (PAPs) in a timely, clear, and culturally appropriate manner. Additionally, a third-party agency will be engaged to conduct E&S external monitoring for the Project. Semi-annual monitoring reports, prepared in accordance with an agreed format, will be submitted for the Bank’s review.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable to the environmental and social aspects of the Project. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) is not triggered as there has been no involuntary resettlement within three years prior to identification of the Project for possible Bank financing. Project activities will occur on lands for which the Borrower secured land use right in 2020 or earlier. While the application of ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is currently not anticipated, this will be confirmed during the final review. The Project is classified as Category B, because (i) no involuntary resettlement; (ii) no impacts on indigenous peoples are expected; and (iii) the campus expansion activities are unlikely to result in significant adverse environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts. The anticipated E&S risks and impacts are expected to be short-term, local, reversible and manageable by implementation of good international practice.Environmental and Social Instruments.The AIIB Loan will finance the expansions and upgrades of Minsheng's three schools in Chongqing. This includes the upgrades of Chongqing College and Vocational College on the existing campuses, as well as Pass College at a new location. The PT is currently undertaking environmental and social due diligence (ESDD). The ESDD will consider the Borrower’s and three colleges’ Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) or equivalent documents, E&S performance of existing facilities, ongoing legacy issues and/or unresolved matters related to land acquisition and resettlement (if any); review reports and studies related to E&S aspects undertaken to date. This ESDD will also identify gaps with AIIB’s ESP and propose an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) to align the Project with AIIB’s ESP principles and requirements.Environmental Aspects.The Project will mainly finance new capital expenditures of Minsheng's three schools in Chongqing, including supporting the construction of technology-enabled education infrastructure, as well as digital education facilities (multimedia classrooms, computer rooms, digitally intelligent blackboards) and student dormitories with digital intelligence functionalities. It will also finance energy saving facilities and waste treatment facilities in the school campuses as well as the purchase of new teaching facilities and equipment that are energy efficient. It is expected that construction risks and impacts will be generated during site development and building construction. These activities may generate dust, vibration, noise, water, wastewater and air pollution as well as waste materials such as spent paint, construction chemicals, solid wastes, domestic wastes, construction debris and lack of access. The Project’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP) should contain mitigation measures to address the risks and impacts. The ESDD will determine the capacity of the Borrower to manage the environmental risks and impacts and to reinforce the ESMS. The ESAP will address the gaps and shortfalls in the EMP that need to be strengthened, while the E&S monitoring plan will be implemented by the Borrower and reported to Bank on a quarterly basis.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project is designed to avoid new land acquisition and resettlement. The upgrades of Chongqing College and Vocational College will occur on the existing campuses, while the Pass College expansion, although greenfield development, the Borrower secured land use right in 2020. This indicates that any land acquisition and resettlement were complete by that time. A due diligence on land acquisition will be incorporated into the ESDD process, with a particular focus on Pass College expansion, given that it is a greenfield development. The other two colleges have been operational for over a decade. If any legacy issues or unresolved matters concerning land acquisition and resettlement are identified, corresponding mitigation measures will be proposed in the ESAP. Social risks may include labor influx during construction, labor and working conditions including occupational health and safety during both construction and operation, as well as community health and safety, particularly life and fire safety management for public access buildings on campus. Measures will be put in place to prevent accidents, injuries and disease associated with the Project. Additionally, the influx of labor during construction phase may also elevate risks associated with gender-based violence (GBV), sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and sexual harassment (SH) (GBV/SEA/SH). Management of these risks will rely on the Borrower’s, contractors’ and colleges’ management procedures and plans. The ESDD will review these procedures and plans, proposing mitigation measures if existing management procedures and plans are found to be insufficient.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Meaningful and culturally appropriate engagement with stakeholders will be carried out throughout the Project cycle involving various categories of stakeholders. The ESDD will review the adequacy of stakeholder engagement process conducted to date and recommend corrective actions as necessary. The E&S instruments will be timely disclosed by both the Borrower and the Bank in an appropriate manner to the public.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and the Arrangement of Monitoring and Reporting.A two-tier and gender sensitive GRM will be established to receive, acknowledge, evaluate, and resolve complaints related to E&S issues. The first tier will be established at the Borrower level, while the second tier will be operational at each of the three colleges individually. This process will be undertaken using understandable and transparent processes that are gender responsive, culturally appropriate, and readily accessible to all segments of the affected people. Records of grievances received, corrective actions taken, and their outcomes will be properly maintained. The information of established GRM and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.

The ESMF will serve as an ES instrument and operational tool during project implementation to avoid, minimize, reduce, and mitigate the ES impacts and risks, and enhance potential development outcomes of the Project. In addition to the ESMF, a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared to define a program for stakeholder engagement, including public information disclosure and meaningful consultation throughout the entire project cycle. An Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) has been prepared to provide for the timely implementation of mitigation measures, monitoring and reporting, and capacity enhancement of the implementing agency. The ESCP includes a timeline for implementing required instruments such as the SEP and ESMF including the Environmental and Social Code of Practice, Waste Management Procedure, Social Impact Assessment, Code of Conduct for contractor and worker, Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM), etc.Environmental Aspects.While the Project is anticipated to bring mostly positive outcomes, there are low-magnitude, reversible, and site-specific environmental risks that might arise during the installation and operation of medical equipment, leading to hazardous and non-hazardous waste generation, and occupational safety concerns for healthcare workers and the community. The Project interventions are expected to increase the volume of medical and other types of waste, energy consumption, quantities of chemical and hazardous substances to be managed, and occupational health and safety risks, such as chemical exposure, noise, electrical safety, and infection control. The ESMF includes an Environmental and Social Management Process with a set of mitigation measures to address the impacts caused by the investments proposed under the Project. It lists ineligible activities for Project funding to avoid activities with significant, complex, irreversible, and/or unprecedented adverse environmental or social impacts. Each Project Management Unit will perform eligibility screening for the project activities under their respective components.Climate Change.Indonesia is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with significant impacts on the economy, lives, and livelihoods of its population, and in particular vulnerable communities in rural, remote parts of the country. The equipment will be installed at the facilities with robust resilience in the face of climate shocks or natural hazards. On climate mitigation, the relevant Energy Star efficiency standards and the International Electrotechnical Commission energy efficiency standards for medical equipment will be applied and included in the equipment specifications.Social Aspects.Overall, the Project has no adverse social impact or significant risk. The Project focuses on the procurement and installation of equipment within existing public health facilities and does not involve the construction of new premises, thus land acquisition is not expected. For the construction of new laboratories funded by the Government budget, the Project will require the Ministry of Health (MoH) to conduct land due diligence per the ESMF and confirm: (i) the availability of land certificate or other recognized land ownership evidence designated for healthcare facilities or laboratories; and (ii) land plot ready to be built (clean and clear).Indigenous Peoples.No groups or communities qualifying as Indigenous Peoples under the ESF will be adversely affected by the Project, as the Project activities focus on provisions of new medical equipment.Gender Aspects.The Project represents a sizeable contribution to gender equality by: (i) improving women’s endowments through investment in health, education, and social protection, and (ii) ensuring the availability and operation of essential health equipment nationwide including closing remaining gaps in maternal mortality and improving women’s access to health services.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.A SEP has been prepared by the MoH to provide guidance and to build and maintain, over time, an inclusive process with the Project’s stakeholders, in particular, the local beneficiaries and other interested parties across the Project cycle. The SEP includes requirements to engage with stakeholders throughout the Project life cycle and as early as possible in the Project development process and in a timeframe that enables meaningful consultations on Project design, in which the nature, scope, and frequency of stakeholder engagement are proportionate to the nature and scale of the Project and its potential risks and impacts. The SEP outlines general principles, information on previous engagement activities with relevant stakeholders during the Project identification and preparation, stakeholder identification including vulnerable communities, and a collaborative strategy as well as the engagement process.The SEP, ESCP, and ESMF have been reviewed with key stakeholders as part of the consultations during the Project preparation process, with the recommendations incorporated in the ES documents.

AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), is applicable to the program.Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment. The safeguards assessment by IMF in 2023 concluded that the current legal environmental framework in Egypt has adequate requirements to address the potential environmental impacts associated with the PAs under this Program. However, for large-scale development projects, the existing legal structure needs to be complemented with good international practices to conduct SESAs to address high-level environmental and social risks associated with the PAs. To mitigate this potential downstream investment risk, with the Technical Assistance from the World Bank. the Government of Egypt has agreed to carry out a strategic environmental and social assessment (SESA) in the selected area to address the potential ES adverse impacts associated with the Program.Environmental and Social AspectBased on the impact assessment conducted by the project team, there would be ES risks and impacts associated with the implementation of prior actions (PAs) under this Program. The environmental impacts and risks associated with actions under PA7 to PA11 of Reform Area 3 are expected to have a net positive environmental impact. However, the potential downstream investment in renewable electricity from the implementation of the PA9 may have potential environmental impacts in a specific location such as air, water, occupational health and safety, land contamination, and biodiversity (terrestrial and avifauna biodiversity due to large land occupation and to possible migratory bird flyways. Additionally, potentially adverse social impacts are anticipated with the downstream implementation of the PA9 including land acquisition and involuntary resettlement of local people for the installation of overhead transmission lines and associated infrastructure. If actual project investment in renewable electricity happens to be materialized in the selected area, the findings from the SESA will inform the scope of an appropriate ES assessment and corresponding instruments to manage relevant ES risks.Information Disclosure, Monitoring and Reporting ArrangementAIIB will disclose a summary of the SESA and the applicable grievance redress mechanism (GRM) at the program level in a timely manner. The Ministry of International Cooperation will be responsible to report to AIIB semi-annually the implementation progress of the Reform Area 3, including the ES aspects – if needed - based on agreed format with AIIB.",,,OK

To provide for a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), ADB’s SPS will apply to the project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed ADB’s SPS and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and the relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs); and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the project.ES Categorization and Rationale.ADB has categorized the ES risks and impacts of the Project as Category B for Environment, B for Involuntary Resettlement, and B for Indigenous Peoples (which are equivalent to Category B if AIIB ESP were applicable). The potential adverse ES impacts associated with the activities considered for financing are limited, not unprecedented or irreversible, localized to the Project’s site, and can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting. The Project is categorized as “low risk” for the Covid-19 Health and Safety risk by ADB. The COVID-19 health and safety risks will be considered as part of the Project level risk assessment plans. Other social issues and risks will also be investigated and if the risks and impacts are real, measures to address would be included in the Project designs outcomes where relevant.E&S Scoping and Planned Instruments.The scope of social risks and impacts are being assessed and will be reconfirmed during project preparation. A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Planning Framework (LARPF) will be prepared to guide the land acquisition and resettlement planning, implementation and monitoring of the Project. A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP) will be developed to manage land acquisition and resettlement impacts by the Project. To address impacts and risks to the local Indigenous Peoples, if any, an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared guiding the assessment, planning, institutional arrangements, and other processes to be followed during implementation stage. An Indigenous People Plan (IPP) will be prepared and implemented if indigenous peoples are found presenting in the project’s areas and the project has impacts on the indigenous people community. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) will be developed which will incorporate actions to address identified gender inequalities within the framework of the Project. On the environmental aspects, an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared for the subprojects in conjunction with the feasibility studies.Environmental Risks and ImpactsThe Project is expected to have negative environmental, health, and safety impacts during construction which include, but not limited to: air emissions; noise generation; contamination of surface water, soil environment and groundwater; impacts to flora and fauna; spoil disposal and use of borrow sites; soil erosion; solid waste generation; wastewater discharge; occupational health and safety; community health and safety; impact to cultural heritage; and other unanticipated impacts. And during operations, potential impacts may include, but not limited to: i) impacts on local ecohydrology, to patterns of flow in terms of water volume and water quality, particularly changes in sediments and/or contamination by pollutants; impacts to movement and migration of riverine fauna; impacts to ground water table; ii) degradation of soils (physical and chemical such as soil erosion, waterlogging and salinization); iii) nutrient management; iv) use and management of pesticides and fertilizers; v) crop residue and solid waste management; vi) community health and safety in terms of infrastructure and equipment design and safety, exposure to water-borne or water-related diseases, water quality for irrigation, and emergency preparedness and response; and vii) impacts on long-term sustainability of the water management system in terms of potential water use conflicts, and unsustainable irrigation practices.Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement.Land will be acquired for upgrading and construction of irrigation systems and flood controlling schemes – particularly the irrigation canal rehabilitations. Land acquisition impacts by the Project, however, are expected insignificant as only small parts of agricultural land of the households would be affected. Physical displacement would not happen as flooding controlling and irrigation structures to be upgraded and constructed are located outside of residential areas. Impacts on agricultural land of individuals/households would not be severe as only narrow strips of agricultural land along the irrigation canals would be required for the canal rehabilitations and small areas of agricultural land would be needed for constructions of flooding controlling schemes. The scale of the land acquisition impacts will be assessed and reconfirmed during project preparation.Ethnic Minorities.The Project is located in the areas where there could be ethnic Cham communities living in the river basins areas. The impacts of the Project on the local ethnic minority communities, if any, are anticipated as limited. Local ethnic minority communities would have better access to irrigation for their farming to increase agricultural productivity. The only potential negative impact of the Project to the local ethnic minorities would be the minor land acquisition impact. The Project will not require large construction contractors for irrigation schemes; in addition, construction sites are out of the residential areas, there would be no disturbances on the Cham ethnic communities. Detailed investigation on the potential impacts of the Project on the local ethnic minority communities will be conducted during the project preparation stage.Gender Aspects.The Project has the potential to contribute to the promotion of gender equity and/or empowerment of women by providing women access to the use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision-making. Better access to irrigation and participation in the Farmer Water Use Committees (FWUCs) and other project’s interventions would improve rural livelihoods and women’s empowerment in water resource management. Accordingly, a gender action plan (GAP) will be developed with various measures to be planned and implemented to address identified gender.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultations, and Information Disclosure.Meaningful consultations will be conducted with the stakeholders during the ES risks and impacts assessment. ES instruments will be prepared with adequate disclosure, including meaningful public consultations. Local authorities, affected households and the communities, including the ethnic minority communities will participate in ES assessment and implementation of ES instruments as well as in the monitoring processes. The ES documentation in English, and summary in Khmer language will be disclosed by the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MoWRAM) on its website and in hard copies in the Project areas. This documentation will also be disclosed on ADB and MoWRAM’s websites - and AIIB website will include links to the documentation on the MoWRAM’s website and ADB’s website.Labor and Working Conditions.Risks and impacts on labor and working conditions include potential presence of minor agricultural workers in the command areas and on occupational health and safety - there is potential exposure to various hazards (physical such as operational hazards and machinery and vehicles; biological such as disease vectors and venomous animals; and chemical such as pesticides and herbicides). The management, mitigation, and monitoring measures to address risks and impacts on labor and working conditions will be included in the EMP.Project-Level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and ES Monitoring.The Project shall establish and maintain a project-level GRM that is proportional, culturally appropriate, transparent, and accessible to receive and facilitate resolution of grievances related to the Project implementation. The Project will also establish and maintain a worker GRM, if needed. In addition to this, the MoWRAM will be responsible for the overall coordination of project monitoring. AIIB and ADB will jointly monitor the implementation of EMP and other ES action plans through biannual implementation support missions. Detail ES monitoring and reporting plan will be discussed and determined with MoWRAM during project preparation.",,Category B,OK

In Jan. 2020, the Ministry of Health (the MOH) activated the Health Emergency Response System. From March 2020, all primary healthcare services were relocated away from the main hospitals. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic and on March 24, 2020, the GOCI closed the country’s borders. Widespread testing, mandatory 14-day quarantine, school closures, domestic travel suspensions and social distancing were enforced during the ensuing lockdown period which began mid-March 2020. The GOCI declared the country COVID-19 free on April 16, 2020.The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant economic threat to the Cook Islands. Due to the shutdown of tourism, the economy is estimated to have contracted by 7 percent in FY20 and projected to further contract by 15.4 percent in FY21, or more if borders remain closed to New Zealand tourists beyond early 2021. The impact on business viability has been severe. The impact on the fiscal position will be significant. In addition to higher expenditures, which will temporarily increase from 36 percent of GDP in FY19 to over 70 percent of GDP in FY21, the collapse in tourism has led to a decline in tax revenues of 7 percent in FY20 and a further expected decline by almost 40 percent in FY21. As a result, the fiscal deficit in FY20 was 2.4 percent of GDP (instead of 1.2 percent planned), and for FY21 it is projected by the ADB to reach 30 percent of GDP or more.","This Loan will be co-financed with ADB as lead co-financier, and the Program’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the provisions of ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) applicable to policy-based lending (PBL).AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to PBL operations. Therefore, as permitted by a decision of the AIIB’s Board of Directors, the provisions of the SPS applicable to PBL will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the Program.Under its SPS, ADB has categorized the program as Category C for environment, Category C for involuntary resettlement and Category C for Indigenous Peoples, on the basis of its assessment of the Program. ADB has confirmed that the Program activities supported by this Loan will be confined to policy and institutional reforms; and that no activity will result in, or lead to, involuntary resettlement or negatively affect Indigenous Peoples or the environment. The Program is expected to have positive social outcomes through its COVID-19 response by sustaining livelihoods, protecting jobs and businesses. The public sector is a key provider of infrastructure and services to low-income households, and improved fiscal management will help ensure that the government has the resources to respond to economic shocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards, which tend to have an adverse effect on the poor, while maintaining critical public services.The Program is categorized by ADB as ""Effective Gender Mainstreaming"" with dedicated actions to ensure that all women employers and employees have access to support, including (i) a wage subsidy for all women in affected businesses, (ii) an unemployment benefit for all women at risk of losing their jobs, (iii) the assurance that all public servants (of which 55.8% are women) will continue to be employed, (iv) the continuation of training opportunities being offered to women at similar rates to men and (iv) grant and credit assistance for women-owned businesses.",,Category C,OK

The adverse impacts were identified during the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) conducted by an independent international E&S consultant assigned by the Lenders. The Borrower supported by the Sponsor has updated the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and relevant E&S management plans. The updated ESIA package includes ESIA report, Non-Technical Summary of the ESIA, Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan (ESMMP), Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Gender Action Plan (GAP), Guide to Land Acquisition and Compensation (GLAC), and Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) of the EPC Contractor.Environmental aspects: The adverse environmental impacts are mainly during the construction phase, which will include dust and air emissions from earthwork and use of machines and motors; soil erosion; spoiled soil and solid waste generation; surface water, groundwater and soil pollution from wastewater, waste, and chemical spills; noise and vibration from blasting and heavy machinery; handling and storage of hazardous materials/chemicals; vegetation clearance for the Right of Way (RoW). Mitigation measures are formulated in the ESMPs, which will be implemented by the EPC contractor to avoid, minimize, or mitigate these adverse impacts. In addition, the Project crosses through (i) Küçükçekmece Basin– International Bird Area (IBA) and Key Biodiversity Area (KBA), and (ii) West Istanbul Grasslands Important Plant Area (IPA). However, the Biodiversity Impact Assessment concluded that both internationally recognized areas crossed by were heavily degraded, and no longer would support biodiversity which qualified as critical habitat (CH). Nevertheless, a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) has been developed, which includes specific conservation actions aimed at achieving No Net Loss / Net Gain for critical habitat. The BAP will be implemented by the Borrower as part of the Construction Environmental and Social Management Plan (CESMP). In addition, cultural heritage baseline and impact assessment studies identified 12 sites on the Project right of way and mitigations designed in the Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP).Social and Gender Aspects: The adverse social impacts are associated with involuntary resettlement and land acquisition, causing both physical and economic displacement. The Project will require a series of new junctions, upgrades to existing connecting roads, and underpasses, overpasses, tunnels, and the construction of pedestrian bridges to maintain connectivity in the area. The route passes through urban, semi-urban, and cultivated areas, the latter to the west of the route. The total area of land to be permanently acquired by the Project is about 550 hectares. The Project will affect 1,523 land parcels with over 81% privately-owned, and one-third being agricultural land. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been developed to define mitigation, compensation, and livelihood restoration measures. In addition, a RAP Fund has been established by the Borrower to complement the KGM resettlement budget to ensure compensations are paid at replacement cost. Other social risks include community health and safety issues and associated gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) risks to workers and communities during construction and operations phases. These adverse impacts will be addressed through the implementation of relevant measures defined in the ES management plans, including the Blasting Management Plan, Community Health, Safety and Security Plan, Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan, Traffic Management Plan, Labor Management Plan (LMP), and Gender Action Plan (GAP).Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.A SEP has been developed to guide meaningful consultations and ensure effective engagement with stakeholders. The ESIA package was disclosed in English and its NTS in Turkish bythe BorrowerandEBRDin August 2023. Over the ESIA disclosure period, multiple consultation sessions have been conducted within the Project area. Letters were sent to local authorities and NGOs to seek their feedback on the project activities and related E&S impacts. A Public Consultation and Disclosure Report was prepared and disclosed, which summarizes the process, feedback received, and the Project’s responses to the comments.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism. A two-tier and multi-channel Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been set up to address project-related complaints from anyone with concerns about or being affected by the Project. The site-specific GRM is actively managed by EPC Community Liaison Officers (CLOs), reporting directly to the EPC Social Manager. The second tier operates at the Borrower (SPV) level, with a project-level Grievance Committee (GC) established to oversee the GRM implementation. The GC is responsible for regularly reviewing grievances raised by internal and external stakeholders, aiming to resolve non-judicial disputes arising from various project-related matters. A community information brochure on GRM procedures has been developed and will be widely disseminated in three languages (English, Turkish and Arabic). The Borrower has a separate internal grievance mechanism to address worker complaints in a timely manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements. The Project will be monitored quarterly at the site throughout construction and semiannually during the first two years of operation by independent Lenders’ ES consultants to ensure the Project’s compliance with the ESAP and the Lenders’ requirements. The Borrower will also submit semi-annual monitoring reports based on the agreed format on construction progress and annual reporting during operations. The Bank will retain the rights to conduct field supervision and monitoring visits during Project implementation.",,Category A,OK

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been categorized as Category B. ESS-1 Environmental and Social Assessment and Management is triggered for this Project. ESS-2 Involuntary Resettlement and ESS-3 Indigenous Peoples are not triggered as there is no land acquisition, no resettlement, no adverse impacts on livelihood and no indigenous peoples involved in this Project.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) has been prepared by the client to address the environmental and social (ES) impacts associated with the Project. Additionally, a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared to outline a program for stakeholder engagement, including public information disclosure and consultation throughout the procurement, operation and maintenance of the new metro rolling stock.Environmental Aspects.The Project will not involve any civil works, and environmental impacts are only related to mobilization, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the metro rolling stock. Transportation of metro cars from the suppliers to Tbilisi Transport Company LLC (TTC)’s facility will generate traffic and health and safety impacts during the transportation. The supplier will submit a Transportation Management Plan to TTC before the mobilization of rail cars. Other potential environmental impacts associated with the operation and maintenance of the new rolling stock include generation of waste (including hazardous waste), wastewater, chemical spills, fire safety risks, noise, vibration, and occupational health and safety hazards. The necessary management measures are outlined in the ESMP. The environmental impacts associated with the decommissioning of old metro cars include the generation of several types of waste, such as metallic, hazardous materials, non-hazardous solid, chemical, and electronic waste. The measures to manage the decommissioning phase impacts are included in the ESMP and it is likely that TTC will involve a licensed contractor to manage the decommissioning of old metro cars. TTC will prepare a specific Decommissioning Phase ESMP prior to the beginning of this phase, addressing waste management, health and safety and emergency preparedness and response. Detailed measures related to management and disposal of asbestos will be included in the Decommissioning Phase ESMP. This plan will be reviewed and approved by the Bank prior to its implementation.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project will improve the mobility of men and women and will contribute towards additional employment generation in formal and informal sectors. The new metro trains will accommodate the needs of all passengers, including children, passengers with luggage, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities, including those with restricted mobility and using wheelchairs. The population of Tbilisi is 53 percent female, with many women heavily relying on public transport, including the metro. There is a risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and harassment for female passengers and female staff during operations. To address these concerns, TTC has implemented a robust policy on sexual harassment, covering both workplace and metro system incidents. The policy explains the complaint mechanism, procedure, the constitution of a committee to hear complaints related to sexual harassment, terms of hearing and monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Metro staff will receive training on GBV and harassment prevention during the implementation of ESMP. The Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will handle gender-related complaints from both passengers and staff, ensuring responsive and effective management of such issues. Under the Project’s capacity building and institutional strengthening component, TTC will offer specialized training, including for female staff, helping them enhance their skills and perform their duties more effectively. One indicator related to training of female staff is included in the Results Monitoring Framework.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions.OHS risks were assessed and the ESMP includes measures to mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards associated with the Project activities. An Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) has been developed as part of the ESMP to manage emergency risks. Regular exercises and drills shall be performed during the Project implementation to ensure adequate emergency response capabilities are always in place. Suppliers and contractors will be required to implement appropriate management measures aligned with the ESMP, including labor and working conditions and health and safety matters. Compliance with the ESMP is mandatory and will be reflected in all relevant agreements and contract documents with suppliers and contractors.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Key stakeholders were identified and consulted during the preparation of the ESMP and SEP, with consultations following the relevant national legislation and AIIB’s ESF. A SEP has been developed and will be executed during Project implementation. The ESMP and SEP in English, along with their executive summaries in Georgian language, aredisclosed by the clientand by AIIB on their respective websites.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Based on the TTC’s existing GRM, a project-level GRM will be established to handle concerns from project-affected people (PAPs) and from project employees. The project-level GRM will also be responsive to the complaints related to GBV and harassment. The GRM will become operational after Project approval. TTC has also established a hotline, publicly displayed in metro cars and stations, for individuals to raise concerns about services. This hotline will also be used for the Project, ensuring timely responses to grievances. The Information of established GRMs including hotlines and AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner. All grievances will be recorded and tracked throughout the Project’s lifecycle.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.Within the Project Implementation Unit, the Deputy Head of TTC Environment and Safety Department will be the overall responsible for supervising the Project ES activities. TTC’s current ES advisor will support the environmental team in implementing the ESMP and SEP. Additionally, the contract Supervision Consultant, including ES staff, will oversee the implementation activities. Both TTC and the Supervision Consultant’s ES staff will monitor the ES issues throughout the life of the Project, including the ESMP implementation.

To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the E&S risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), ADB’s SPS (2009) will apply to the Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed ADB’s SPS and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and the relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs); and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for LLRN. ADB has categorized the E&S risks of the Project as Category A for Environment, A for Involuntary Resettlement, and C for Indigenous Peoples (which are equivalent to Category A if AIIB’s ESP were applicable). The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) issued a Certificate of Non-Overlap on August 20, 2024, confirming that the LLRN does not affect any ancestral land or domain of indigenous cultural communities. The category is based on risks due to large-scale construction activities, impacts on the lake ecosystems, and displacement of Project-affected People (PAP).Environment and Social Instruments:In 2019, during the Feasibility Study (FS) Stage, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study for the Laguna Lakeshore Road Network (LLRN) was carried out following the procedural requirements and scope of impact assessment specified under the Philippine Environmental Impact Statement System (PEISS) and the ADB SPS. Upon completion of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP), an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) was secured on 19 May 2022 by the Department of Public Works and Highway (DPWH). The EIA was upgraded based on the LLRN alignment in the detailed engineering design (DED) in April 2024 which has been disclosed on ADB website in May 2024 and AIIB website in July 2024.The E&S instruments have appropriately assessed the significant environmental and social impacts of LLRN and adequately addressed the issues for mitigating the identified risks and impacts throughout the project cycle.Environmental Aspects:The environmental assessment for LLRN identified concerns such as flooding, water quality, and impacts on the lake ecosystem. The Project is in a flood-prone area and vulnerable to typhoons, though flooding risks, exacerbated by the embankment, are minimal. The Project design has incorporated the results of the flood analysis and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is in place to manage flood risks. Dredging will help reduce sedimentation and flooding risks. Water quality in Laguna Lake is below standards, and construction activities pose risks of spills and sediment runoff, with mitigation measures in place. Air and noise pollution are expected during the construction, with noise levels exceeding acceptable limits in some areas. Noise monitoring and the usages of sound barriers are proposed, with no significant noise impacts expected during the operations. In addition, the issues on critical habitat and biodiversity impacts were studied and assessed. Although the Project is not within the vicinity of any declared protected areas, national parks, watershed reserves nor wildlife preserves and sanctuaries, to help achieve net improvement in biodiversity of the lake, a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) has been developed, and additionally a separate assessment will be completed for the preparation of the Freshwater Habitat Planting Plan. The EMP includes comprehensive measures to monitor and mitigate environmental impacts throughout the project's life cycle.Social Aspects:The involuntary resettlement impacts of the Project are expected to be significant. The Project will impact areas in San Pedro, Biñan, Santa Rosa, and Cabuyao, consisting of private and government lands. There will be economic impacts to commercial businesses, fish pens and fish cages. To mitigate the adverse social impacts, a Resettlement Framework (RF) and the Resettlement Plan (RP) has been prepared in accordance with ADB SPS (2009). The RF sets out requirements in terms of standards, entitlements, and practices to be applied by the Government of the Philippines (GoP) to appropriately address and mitigate involuntary resettlement impacts caused by the Project. The RP provides compensation at replacement cost for all PAPs whose land or assets are lost due to land acquisition or Right of Way (ROW) clearing. In addition to compensation, the RP outlines support for income restoration, including relocation assistance, training programs, and job placement opportunities. The DPWH will work closely with local government units (LGUs) and housing agencies to implement the resettlement process and ensure compensation is provided before displacement occurs. Specific measures are also in place for informal settler families (ISFs), offering them access to government socialized housing and livelihood programs. No construction will begin until full compensation and assistance have been provided to affected families, in accordance with the RP.Gender Aspects:LLRN has been classified by ADB as ""Effective Gender Mainstreaming"" due to its efforts in promoting gender equality and empowering women. A comprehensive Gender Assessment and Action Plan (GAAP) has been developed. This plan addresses the key gender issues identified among PAPs and outlines actions to mitigate these challenges. Key gender-related challenges identified include limited participation of women in decision-making processes, gender discrimination in infrastructure projects, and heightened risks of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Harassment (SEAH). To promote gender inclusivity, the Project includes gender-balanced stakeholder consultations and women-only focus groups. The implementation of the GAAP will be overseen by the DPWH UPMO RMC II. Quarterly and annual progress reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB and AIIB, and DPWH UPMO RMC II will facilitate gender-related missions and inspections to ensure effective implementation of the GAAP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions:OHS and Community Health and Safety (CHS) risks are expected during both the construction and operational phases of the Project. During construction, the primary risks include road accidents due to the movement of trucks, vehicles, and equipment, hazards associated with working over water for the construction of the viaduct and embankment, risks from pile driving activities, working at heights, falling debris, and potential injuries to workers. In the operational phase, road safety risks are anticipated, primarily related to increased traffic and higher speed limits on the bridge and viaduct, leading to a higher likelihood of road accidents. The EMP identifies several mitigation measures to address these risks. Contractors will be required to prepare and implement OHS Plan, an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan, and a Traffic Management Plan. Additionally, to effectively manage labor and employment conditions, the EMP has outlined hiring requirements for contractors which should have provisions such as prioritizing and hiring local skilled and unskilled laborers, women skilled and unskilled laborers, particularly giving priority to the affected communities, transparent and non-discriminatory recruitment procedures, etc. These provisions will be incorporated in the bidding documents.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.As part of the GoP requirements and ECC application process during the scoping stage of the EIA, stakeholder engagement commenced at the early stages (FS stage) and stakeholder identification and Information and Education Campaign (IEC) meetings have been completed for the Project. In general, the outcomes of these consultations have been positive and the support of the LGUs and key stakeholders were evident through their participation in the activities conducted for the LLRN. In addition, the Project has outlined a stakeholder engagement and communication plan that will serve as a guide for executing consultations throughout the Project implementation. The ES documentation in English has been disclosed by DPWH on its website in July 2024, on ADB website (May 2024) andAIIB’s website (July 2024).Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM):LLRN has established a comprehensive GRM to address and resolve project-related grievances in accordance with ADB SPS (2009). The GRM is designed to be accessible to all individuals and entities within the LLRN's area of influence, handling complaints related to property damage, worker behavior, noise, traffic congestion, safety concerns, and disruptions to livelihoods and public services. A multi-layered grievance process has been developed, including levels at the contractor, construction supervision consultant, local government units, and DPWH UPMO. The GRM will also extend to workers who may raise concerns about working conditions or labor rights violations. Information about the Project GRM and the Accountability Mechanism (AM) of ADB has been disseminated to PAPs through public consultations and is included in the EIA, RP, and other environmental and social documents. Additionally, the existing DPWH complaints system, accessible via walk-in forms, email, phone, or social media, will be available to all stakeholders throughout the project.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangement.The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) is the Executing Agency (EA) who is responsible for overall coordination, policy direction, and administration of project activities, including safeguards. DPWH will engage an external monitoring expert/agency, acceptable to ADB as per the requirement for a safeguard category A project financed by ADB. DPWH will prepare the monitoring reports to AIIB and ADB semi-annually, and AIIB will retain the rights to conduct implementation monitoring and supervision for the Project along with ADB.",,Category A,OK

A designated Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) Fund will be created to cover the costs of livelihood restoration compensation that are not covered by the national expropriation budget. Turkish legislation does not provide compensation to informal land users, income losses for businesses and transactional costs which are covered, along with a contingency, in the RAP Fund to achieve the livelihood restoration requirements of EBRD PR5.The Project will be jointly cofinanced by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and AIIB (the Cofinanciers) and will follow the arrangements set by the agreement between the Cofinanciers signed in April 2021. Therefore, EBRD Environmental and Social Policy (2014) (EBRD ESP), EBRD Procurement Policies and Rules (2017) (EBRD PPR), and EBRD Independent Project Accountability Mechanism will apply in lieu of AIIB Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB ESP), AIIB Procurement Policy, and AIIB Project-affected People’s Mechanism, respectively.","The Project will be cofinanced with the EBRD. To ensure a harmonized approach on addressing the Project's environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts, and as permitted under AIIB ESP, EBRD’s ESP (2014) and related Performance Requirements (PRs) will apply to the Project in lieu of the AIIB’s ESP.

The Project is classified as Category A (equivalent to Category A if AIIB's ESP were applicable), since the ES risks and impacts associated with the construction and operation of a long-distance railway are significant, irreversible, and diverse.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) (including an Environmental and Social Management Plan - ESMP), an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), a Non-Technical Summary (NTS), a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), a Guide to Land Acquisition and Compensation for communities (GLAC) and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) have been prepared and disclosed on the websites ofAYGMandEBRDin English and Turkish. AIIB’s projectwebpagealso provides the links to the disclosed ES documents. The ESIA package and RAP are also available at multiple locations along the Project’s alignment.The route of the high speed railway is generally aligned with the existing Ispartakule-Cerkezkoy railway line, crossing habitats that are common and widespread, with no national or international protected areas in the alignment. The biodiversity and critical habitat assessment identified Priority Biodiversity Features (PBFs) and critical habitat. The Project crosses two designated Important Bird Areas (IBAs), but the impacts on these areas are expected to be limited. A Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) has been developed, including specific conservation actions aimed at achieving No Net Loss / Net Gain for PBFs and critical habitat.Most of the adverse environmental impacts are construction related. Appropriate mitigation measures for addressing these impacts and risks are included in the ESMP. During operation phase, noise and vibration will be mitigated through installation of noise barriers and through specific track design measures.The Project is considered 100% Climate Mitigation Financing (EUR300 million), as it (i) reduces the carbon intensity of train travel by increasing the transportation capacity, and (ii) induces modal shift away from road transport. Anticipated GHG emission reduction will be 850,471 tCO2e over the first 30 years of operation.An occupational health and safety plan will be developed for construction and operation phases to manage potential impacts to workers and communities, including labor rights of construction workers and their working conditions, and addressing health and safety risks to workers and communities. The Project will also identify and address any gender issues, including gender-based violence and harassment risks (GBVH) to workers, communities and passengers, and will develop and implement a stand-alone gender equality and GBVH action plan.The total area of land affected by the Project is estimated at 503 ha, which will be acquired on a permanent basis physically displacing 59 households and 509 secondary structures. A RAP and associated GLAC have been developed to define mitigation, compensation, and livelihood restoration measures in line with national law and PR 5.Consultations have been undertaken to disseminate the findings of the ESIA and RAP. A SEP has been prepared defining engagement activities during the Project lifecycle including alternative engagement approaches to mitigate risks related to COVID-19 in line with national authorities and WHO guidance.

The Resettlement Plans (RPs) will also be prepared during the implementation phase if land acquisition is required.Environmental Aspects.The potential environment risks and impacts related to the Project during the construction and operation/maintenance phases include (i) air pollution, noise and vibration; (ii) soil disturbance; (iii) vegetation management; (iv) waste management and the disposal of outdated technology; (v) management of construction camps; (vi) occupational and community health and safety risks, including traffic safety and emergency response; (vii) environmental risks related to snow removal and snow barriers; (viii) risks associated with routine maintenance activities; (ix) increased energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions of enhanced systems; and (x) potential impacts on culturally and naturally protected areas, including habitat loss, fragmentation, and displacement. These risks will be managed by implementing the various management sub-plans prepared for the Project, which contain both Construction-ESMP and Operations-ESMP to manage the risks associated with operations in addition to the construction phase risks. In addition, the proposed railway route passes through a couple of these protected areas and it is also adjacent to several Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs). However, the habitat along the proposed alignment is already modified due to 60 years of railway operations. The new construction in these areas will strictly remain within existing rail corridor, and any new land development will be outside protected areas. This will avoid further impacts on critical habitats and species. The ESIA completed for the Project has concluded that using the existing railway route will not encroach into the critical habitats. To further manage these risks, a comprehensive Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) has been prepared by the Project.Social Aspects. During the Project implementation, social risks and impacts are associated with potential livelihood impacts due to land acquisition, physical and economic displacement, as well as risks related to labor and working conditions, labor influx, community health and safety, cultural heritage, and risk of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH) due to the Project being implemented across five provinces including in hard-to-reach areas. Considering the primary brownfield nature of the Project and the Government of Türkiye’s existing ownership of surrounding land within the corridor’s right-of-way (RoW), the Project’s land needs are expected to be met without significant land acquisition. The infrastructure rehabilitation may result in moderate physical displacement and relocation of houses and other fixed assets, loss of land and non-land assets, and temporary access restrictions to land use within the railroad RoW. The extent of land acquisition will be determined once detailed engineering designs, including power transmission lines and access roads, are completed by the contractors and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Efforts will be made to avoid environmentally sensitive, agriculturally significant and residential areas. An RF has been prepared, and RP and Livelihood Restoration Plans (LRPs) will be developed as needed during Project implementation.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS).During construction, the primary OHS risks include exposure to high levels of noise and vibration, risks of falling from heights, and hazards associated with the handling of chemicals and heavy machinery. The construction of railway tracks for the Project will primarily utilize mechanized and automated methods, significantly reducing the need for manual labor. Contractors will also develop and implement their own management plans and safety plans. To mitigate these risks, an Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP) has been developed. The project plans include provisions to address emergencies related to occupational and traffic accidents, with a focus on railway operations. Contractors will be required to provide all employees with training on OHS, including emergency preparedness and response.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.The SEP document identified the stakeholders and provided guidelines and a program for communicating with them. The PIU will keep continued engagement with communities around the RoW during project implementation to manage risks, ensure benefits for affected local communities and handle labor influx-induced impacts and grievance management arrangements. All the ES management plans have been disclosed and consulted. The ES instruments in English and summaries in local language (Turkish language) have been disclosed by theGeneral Directorate of Infrastructure Investment (Altyapı Yatırımları Genel Müdürlüğü, AYGM)and by theWB on their website. The links for this documentation have also been disclosed on AIIB’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).AYGM and the PIU will implement a project-level GRM as part of their ES Management System to address grievances from Project-affected individuals. This GRM will document and oversee complaints related to various issues, including environmental concerns and compensation processes while allowing for anonymous submissions. If grievances are not satisfactorily resolved, they can be escalated to a Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC), composed of local and institutional representatives, for further evaluation. Additionally, a separate Workers' GRM will be established for employees and subcontractors, facilitating various avenues for complaint submissions, including a grievance box. Worker representatives will be involved in the resolution process, ensuring transparency and responsiveness. The information of established GRMs and the Independent Accountability Mechanism (IAM) of WB will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner. The PIU will maintain a master database to track all complaints and monitor the GRM's effectiveness throughout the Project.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.Reporting requirements and reporting responsibilities have also been allocated between the contractor, supervision consultant, PIU support consultant, and AYGM. These implementing entities will prepare and submit regular monitoring reports based on agreed format on the Project’s ES performance throughout the Project implementation period. AIIB will monitor the Project’s ES management performance together with WB through these reports and during its implementation support missions.",,Category B,OK

2024,Türkiye,Urban,Sovereign,Türkiye: Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness - 2,https://www.aiib.org/en/projects/details/2024/approved/turkiye-istanbul-seismic-risk-mitigation-and-emergency-preparedness-2.html,Financing Amount,Approved Financing: USD335 million,Approved,"The objectives of the Project are to improve the disaster resilience of critical public facilities and to enhance emergency preparedness and resilience of the City of Istanbul. The objectives of the Project are to improve the disaster resilience of critical public facilities and to enhance emergency preparedness and resilience of the City of Istanbul. Building on the highly successful program initiated and implemented by the World Bank after the devastated Marmara earthquake in 1999, the program has since received support from many International Finance Institutions (IFIs) including AIIB which has financed two projects, Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness (ISMEP) and ISMEP-Additional Financing (ISMEP-AF) with the total amount of USD465 million since 2020.

These buildings were either demolished or closed for safety reasons after the 2023 earthquake. This has resulted in reallocating students and teachers from these schools to continue their studies at nearby schools resulting in two-shifts due to limited space. Therefore, returning these affected students to safe and normal learning environment as soon as possible is one of the highest priorities of the government.As the preliminary assessment recently conducted shows that only 16 out of the 40 schools are suitable for retrofitting while the other 24 schools require reconstruction which requires substantially higher level of investm�ent. As most of the resources provided by the ISMEP and ISMEP-AF projects have already been committed, the government needs additional funding to complete the reconstruction and retrofitting of these 40 public schools as soon as possible. The government has first turned to AIIB for continued support of the program due mainly to the fact that AIIB has been able to provide timely support with value addition including implementation support and advice on nature-based solutions and climate resilience. Since the financing gaps to support other priority public buildings are substantial, the government has also been in discussion with other multilateral development banks including European Investment Bank (EIB), Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), and Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), to secure potential support to bridge any financing gap. Feasibility study reports for these additional buildings are being carried out and funded by the ISMEP-AF project.Components of the Project:Component A: Enhancing Emergency Preparedness. This component aims to enhance the emergency preparedness of the City of Istanbul by strengthening the capacity of Istanbul’s Provincial Directorate of Disaster and Emergency and other first responders. Specifically, the component will support: (i) the provision of emergency equipment such as IT and emergency communications equipment, medical rescue and search and rescue equipment, and specialized emergency vehicles, etc.; (ii) public awareness and training; and (iii) any technical assistance to enhance emergency preparedness and responses.Component B: Seismic Risk Mitigation for Public Facilities. This component aims to reduce the risk of future earthquake damages to critical public facilities in order to save lives and ensure their continued functioning operation in the event of an earthquake. The component will mainly consist of retrofitting and reconstruction of the existing priority public facilities. IPCU has already identified 40 public schools to be included in the Project based on the ISMEP program’s established rules. The component will also support feasibility studies, detailed designs, and construction supervision.Component C: Project Management Support. This component will support IPCU to implement the Project in an efficient and transparent manner and continue to build the institutional capacity to sustain the implementation of the Seismic Risk Mitigation and Preparedness program beyond the life of the Project. Specifically, the component will comprise IPCU’s operational costs and project management support, including support to monitoring and evaluation, environmental and social safeguards, procurement and financial management aspects.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB's Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) applies to the Project. The Project will be prepared consistent with the Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL). ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) will apply to the Project. Based on the current information, ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) and ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not be triggered, as Project activities will not cause involuntary resettlement and no Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have a collective attachment to, the Project area. The Project is assigned Category B under the ESP due to the limited potentially significant adverse environmental and social (ES) impacts of the construction activities and availability of common mitigations to manage the risks and impacts that are expected.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Environmental and Social Management Plan Framework (ESMPF) was developed in 2005 for the initial World Bank ISMEP project and has been utilized by a number of International Finance Institutions (IFIs) involved in subsequent financing. The ESMPF was updated in 2010, and an AIIB specific version was prepared for the Bank’s first round of funding in 2019. The ESMPF for AIIB ISMEP projects was updated in 2022 and again in the first half of 2024. An ESMPF has been selected as the primary ES instrument for the projects as detailed information on the subprojects that will be undertaken is not available at the time of financing approval. The ESMPF establishes the minimum standards that will be adopted for each selected subproject to support conformance with AIIB’s ESP. Construction Environmental and Social Management Plans (CESMPs) are required to be developed by each subproject contractor, aligned with the ESMPF. The ESMPF has been revised for the current Project to take account of updates in AIIB’s ESF 2024 and in Türkiye ES laws and regulations.Environmental Aspects.The Project is not expected to have any significant adverse impact on any sensitive environmental receptors. Construction activities will temporarily result in localized noise, dust and combustion emissions, construction waste generation, and potentially sedimentation of the sewage system on and near project sites. Off-site impacts will be induced by the production of construction material, including but not limited to the use of natural resources such as water and energy consumption, their transportation to the site, and the disposal of debris and other waste. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will have special provisions or management plans for hazardous waste materials such as asbestos and medical waste as well as sensitive impacts such as noise and dust management. In addition, none of the targeted buildings are located within registered cultural heritage areas. However, due to the historical nature of Istanbul, activities to be conducted as part of the Project may occur adjacent to or near important cultural resources. A chance-finds procedure will be implemented to protect cultural resources.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project will not induce any physical or economic resettlement. Social impacts will comprise construction-induced nuisances such as noise, dust emissions, access restriction, and risks to community health and safety for adjacent residents and structures and concurrent users of facilities or buildings being renovated while potentially in partial use, such as schools or hospitals. Public buildings targeted for reconstruction will adopt universal design principles. During the construction, students and teachers will be reallocated to nearby facilities to minimize learning disruption. Transition plan and actions to mitigate any significant adverse impact on the students and teachers' access to educational buildings, preceding the assessment and temporary relocation of the facilities. Additionally, all schools and hospitals will be designed using accessibility facilities such as ramps and elevators and have adequate facilities for women, such as separate bathrooms. As part of the enhancement of the Project, IPCU will deliver Gender-Based Violence (GBV) training sessions and identify opportunities to promote equal access to employment. In addition, the Project will use universal design features for people with disabilities.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions.Project activities will involve construction risks such as earthworks, excavations, work at height, noise, underground activities, and electrical hazards during construction. The contractors will develop and implement the CESMPs in accordance with the ESMPF. CESMPs will include procedures for work-related accident prevention and emergency preparedness and response. IPCU will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures. The contractors will also implement human resource policies aligned with AIIB's requirements, especially for preventing Labor and Working Conditions issues across their operations and those of subcontractors.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.All construction projects are subject to public consultations under Turkish regulations. The engagement process includes public hearings, focus group discussions, interviews, surveys, and communication materials. Particular attention will be paid to the inclusion of men and women in all consultations to ensure that their respective priorities and concerns are considered, particularly in the planning and execution of the sub-projects. The ESMPF in English and its executive summary in Turkish have been disclosed on theAIIB’sandProject'swebsites.Project’s Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A Project-level GRM has been developed and implemented, which includes multiple channels for stakeholders to raise grievances to IPCU and a process for investigating and responding to grievances. AIIB has confirmed that the established GRM has been functioning appropriately on the projects implemented as part of the previous funding. The GRM for the Project as well as the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of the Bank (both in English and local language) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The IPCU will be responsible for the overall coordination, supervision, and monitoring of the Project's ES aspects and to ensure compliance with ESP requirements. The IPCU has established an ES specialist team to oversee Project implementation and monitor ES aspects. The IPCU will provide AIIB with semi-annual ES monitoring reports, which will be prepared based on an agreed format, during the Project implementation period. In addition, AIIB will conduct on-site ES supervision missions in line with the Bank's implementation support missions and strengthen the IPCU's ES management efforts.",,Category B,OK

To support a harmonized approach to addressing the environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), WB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) are applicable for this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. The Bank has reviewed WB’s ESF and ESSs and is satisfied that (i) the ESF and ESSs are consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the relevant ES Standards (ESS) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. WB has assigned substantial risk rating (equivalent to Category B as per AIIB’s ESP) to this Project due to the scale and magnitude of ES impacts of this Project that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to relevant ESSs, procedures, and guidelines.Environmental and Social Instruments: A preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) have been prepared and will be finalized as the detailed designs are completed during early project implementation. During project preparation, a preliminary Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared based on available preliminary technical designs. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has identified potentially affected and interested stakeholders, including a project level grievance redress mechanism (GRM) with designated national and regional focal points. Additionally, Labor Management Procedures (LMP) have been developed, informed by the proposed road upgrading works and workforce estimates drawn from past and ongoing projects. Additional ES staff will be recruited as needed before the civil works commence.Environment Aspects: The Project’s potential environmental risks and impacts are associated with infrastructure activities (i.e., highway upgrading and supporting infrastructure) and potential capacity constraints within QAJ in terms of ensuring ES compliance due to the large geographic scope of the proposed operations. Although the Project could potentially affect a small part of Saiga’s winter migration range, the preliminary biodiversity assessment indicates that the A17 highway will not impact the antelope's primary habitat. The Project will not affect natural or critical habitats and species of ecological and conservation significance as the A17 corridor does not pass through known legally protected areas of high value and sensitivity, Ramsar sites, or Key Biodiversity Areas of the region. Saiga Tatarica, which, although previously classified as an endangered species, is no longer classified as a 'threatened' species by the Government. Other potential risks typical to road upgrading works include (i) increased pollution due to construction waste, (ii) generation of dust, noise, and vibration due to the movement of construction vehicles and machinery, (iii) operational or accidental spills of fuel and lubricants from the construction machinery, (iv) traffic and road safety risks to workers, affected communities and road users as well as occupational health and safety (OHS) issues, and (v) improper reinstatement of construction sites upon completion of works. The anticipated road upgrading works impacts are largely temporary, predictable, reversible, and can be readily mitigated.Social and Gender Aspects: The social risks and potential impacts are associated with land acquisition and restrictions on land use during construction, as well as community health and safety associated with potential labor influx. The Project does not anticipate major land acquisition since no greenfield road construction will be financed. Road widening, route alignment and establishment of ancillary facilities (both temporary and permanent) may require acquisition of land beyond the existing Right of Way (RoW). The Project expects to affect around 260 private and state-owned land parcels along the proposed corridor. Two potential displacement impacts affecting local businesses are currently envisaged. During the construction phase, the communities or villages connected to the A17 road may be exposed to health and safety risks from Project construction activities, and labor influx may result in spreading communicable diseases due to overcrowding and poor living conditions that may affect the host communities if such risks are not contained. These risks are expected to be mitigated through implementation of relevant measures incorporated in the RAP, ESMP and cascaded to the Contractors’ ESMPs. In addition, the potential impact of Project activities on sexual exploitation and abuse/sexual harassment (SEA/SH) risks in the community have been assessed as part of the ESIA and measures are identified to prevent the potential negative impacts caused by the influx of migrant workers in the community and the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and included in the ESMP. The PIU will include a Social Development Specialist to manage GBV/ SEA/SH risks and impacts at the project level.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions (LWC):The road construction of this magnitude would require a substantial amount of workforce. The potential OHS risks due to construction activities are being assessed. Relevant project specific policies related to OHS and LWC have been reviewed, and the necessary mitigation measures are reflected in the ESMP. The LMP address LWC related risks involving and affecting the significant labor force contracted for the Project.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultations, and Information Disclosure: Consultations on the draft preliminary ESIA, ESMP, and RAP were carried out during these instruments' development. Potentially affected and interested stakeholders were identified as part of the Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP). During the construction, the contractor will be required to regularly conduct consultations with the local communities and report to the Borrower monthly. The ES documents have been disclosed in English and the local languages at theBorrower’sandBank’swebsites.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism(GRM): The Project will utilize the existing national and regional channels to file the complaints who believe they have been or are likely to be adversely affected by the Project. The GRMs, respectively for project-affected people and workers, will be established in accordance with the requirements of the relevant WB’s ESSs, including requirements on public consultations and disclosure of the GRM and WB’s Independent Accountability Mechanism (IAM) to Project stakeholders.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.The Borrower will be responsible for coordination, supervision, and monitoring of Project and will submit semi-annual monitoring reports based on the agreed format. In collaboration with the WB, close supervision will be conducted during the first two years to support the Borrower in finalizing the ES package and ensuring that all relevant mitigation measures are in place before any civil works commerce.

The implementation period is expected from July 2022 to December 2023.","The loan is co-financed with the WB as lead co-financier, and therefore the project’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the WB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and the ES Standards under ESF. To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the WB ESF will apply to the project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed the WB’s ESF and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List and the relevant ES Standards; and (b) the monitoring procedures in place are appropriate for the project.The WB has categorized the ES risks of the project as “Substantial” (which is equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable). The Ministry of Health (MoH) has prepared the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for the parent Project and has updated them for the proposed Project. The updated ESMF covers all activities, as well as procedures for the screening and the identification of environmental and social risks and mitigation measures to be implemented in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine procurement and deployment, which include ensuring effective on-site medical waste management, storage, transportation, and disposal schemes. Mitigation measures will be based on the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 response technical guidance on limiting viral contagion in healthcare facilities, the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines, respective national regulations and other good international industry practices. The ESMF includes an Infection and Prevention Control Protocol for Healthcare Settings and Waste Management Plan for Hospitals, which describe in detail appropriate waste management practices applicable.The updated SEP covers identified primary stakeholders for all activities and integrates elements of the Government communication plan to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. The SEP will continue to be a key instrument for community outreach on issues related to social distancing, higher risk demographics, and quarantine measures. Since the Project includes all provinces in Türkiye, existing national grievance mechanisms that are already in use will be integrated to newly established Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). The GRM also allows workers to promptly inform management of labor issues, such as a lack of personal protective equipment, unreasonable overtime, stress and any Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment related issues in the workplace. This workers’ GRM allows for anonymous grievances and has an appeal's process in place. Responsible party for the maintenance and monitoring of the GRM will be MoH through its Project Management and Support Unit.The ES instruments including the ES Commitment Plan, ESMF (including the Labor Management Procedures) and SEP have been disclosed by theMoHin April 2022.The Project implementation will conduct appropriate stakeholder engagement, proper awareness-raising on COVID-19 prevention and control and vaccine access, and timely information dissemination. WB will conduct regular project implementation monitoring and the ES monitoring reports will be shared with AIIB.

Given the emergency nature of this Project, a phased approach for addressing environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts has been adopted, as permitted under the ESP for Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance. The Project has been categorized as Category B and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) including a generic Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) will be used as the Project’s ES instrument. Under the phased approach, the preparation of the ESMPF may be deferred to the Project implementation phase. Consequently, the Bank may approve the Project prior to the preparation of the ESMPF and the field-based ES due diligence.Given the nature and potential of spread of the COVID-19 pathogen, the risks in Cambodia are considered to be significant by the Bank. However, the project is expected to have mostly positive ES impacts and generate local economic development and create jobs in rural areas supported by the Project and WASH component and the promotion of hygiene activities, contributing to preventing a wider spread of the disease during project implementation. The ESMPF will review national and local laws and regulations on environmental and social management. It will also include mitigation actions for improving capacity and training on the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment, and social and behavioral awareness during project preparation and project implementation. The use of nature-based solutions and indigenous material is expected to reduce environmental impacts due to construction. The potential environmental impacts of the project will be from the construction of the rural roads and community ponds, which mostly will be temporary, are limited to the project area, and reversible in nature during construction phase. Mitigation measures to address potential risks will be identified in the ESMP.The project components on rehabilitation and restoration of existing rural roads and community ponds, does not require acquisition of land. Rehabilitation of the existing roads will be implemented within the existing right of way of the roads. The construction of new ponds, which may require about 0.25 hectare each, is expected to have limited or no land acquisition impacts. In addition to the ESMPF, a resettlement planning framework (RPF), and Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared to guide the assessment of subprojects identified if there are any involuntary resettlement impacts or impacts to Indigenous Peoples or ethnic minorities. The ESMPF will also include the conduct of due diligence on lands of existing roads and ponds for rehabilitation and restoration. The ESMPF will also provide measures to support equitable access to project benefits for women and children, the elderly and the disabled. If land acquisition of individuals and/or households is required, a resettlement plan will be prepared for the project road/pond following the provisions of the RPF for implementation and monitoring. Similarly, if any ethnic minority group is found staying in the project area and or is affected by the road rehabilitation/pond construction – an ethnic minority people plan will be developed in consultations with the ethnic minority group(s) and relevant agencies following the provisions envisaged in the IPPF for implementation and monitoring. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan will be prepared and an appropriate project level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be included as an element of the ESMPF, RPF, and IPPF. Construction works for the rural road and community pond upgrading may require the engagement of workers, both from outside and within the communities. The ESMPF will include provisions for the Borrower to ensure that the project: (i) complies with applicable labor laws, (b) provides equal pay for equal work of equal value regardless of gender and ethnic groups, and on (c) labor and working conditions. Training to the local residents interested to participate in the civil works or the operation and maintenance will be provided by a non-government organization financed under the Project to ensure good practices on occupational health and safety, guided by the Environment Code of Practice. A Gender Action Plan will be prepared for implementation to ensure that gender specific opportunities as well as gender-specific adverse risks and impacts under the Projects are identified, mitigation measures to avoid or reduce such risks and impacts, including measures to address the risks of gender-based violence are developed and implemented, and women in the project area are benefited from the project implementation.The ESMPF will be prepared following Loan effectiveness in parallel with development of the Project’s detailed design and updated regularly as the COVID-19 situation evolves. All the activities will be screened, and relevant ES assessment, consultations, and ES instruments will be prepared before these are initiated.

The proposed substations, which are already identified and finalized, will be mostly located on government land or AEGCL’s own land. The acquisition of land is not foreseen for the transmission line component in the project. Design and construction of substations and transmission lines will be undertaken to minimize negative social impacts in compliance with the ESMP, which addresses land acquisition, adverse effect on agriculture and/or livelihoods, associated construction disturbances and other risks (including gender-based violence). If permanent or temporary land acquisition is required in certain cases, it will be carried out by negotiating with the landowners in the presence of district revenue officers as per the guidelines mentioned in the RPF, following national laws: ‘Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’, National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, 2007 Provision in the Electricity Act, 2003 read with relevant provisions of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and AIIB’s ESP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions and Supply Chain.As continuation of the Assam program (currently in implementation), AEGCL shall maintain applying adequate health and safety measures for project workers, and bidding documents will include clauses on how contractors will address health and safety requirements. The ESMP identifies key OHS risks and requires the establishment and implementation of Contractor OHS plans. Safety risks to community members and third parties also exist. There are hazards associated with excavations and mobilization of equipment and materials, and risks of falling into pits or being struck by heavy equipment. These hazards and risks are identified in the ESMP and the project is committed to applying standard industry mitigation measures. AEGCL will supervise and monitor that civil works contractors apply the ESMP and comply with applicable labor laws and regulations, including adopting and enforcing the codes of conduct for workers to mitigate potential labor-related issues (including guidelines for resolution of Gender Based Violence).Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Consultations concerning the ESMPF, model ESIA and generic ESMP have been conducted. The consultations will continue during preparation of subproject specific ESIAs and project implementation. The English versions of the ESMPF and ESIA and Assamese versions of the executive summaries of the ESMPF are disclosed onAEGCL’s websiteand will also be disclosed on AIIB’s website, with hard copies made available in the project area.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Under the current program, a functioning project-level multi-tier GRM was developed in accordance with the requirements of the ESP, which will continue to be applied for this project. Locally appropriate public consultations and disclosure processes will be conducted timely to disseminate information about the GRM for new subprojects under the Phase II program including the information of Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM). Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by the project will be able to submit complaints to the project-level GRM for their resolution. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for worker’s grievance.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The monitoring and supervision under the current program will be maintained and applied for this project.  The PMU Project Director, supported by E&S personnel, will be responsible for compliance monitoring and supervising the implementation of the ESMP. Compliance monitoring will be carried out against key performance indicators set out in the ESMP and findings will be reported semi-annually to AIIB based on an agreed format. The Bank will also undertake its own compliance field monitoring missions as needed, to verify findings. The frequency of the missions will depend on implementation progress and complexity.",USD186 million,Category B,OK

The initial Environmental and Social (E&S) due diligence determined that ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) applies to the assessment of E&S impacts of Project activities. ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) also applies as Project-related activities can lead to adverse direct and indirect impacts on waste pickers and those who derive income from landfills. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not apply to this Project as no Indigenous Peoples are identified according to the AIIB team’s desk review and field visit. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been assigned Category A, considering the potential adverse E&S risks and impacts from upgrading of the existing landfill and construction of integrated waste treatment and its associated facilities.Environmental and Social Instruments.Since not all subprojects to be financed are finalized in term of detailed design and location of supporting facilities, as a result, a framework approach to E&S risk management will be applied and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) has been developed which includes a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF). The ESMPF and RPF will guide the preparation of site-specific Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and site specific Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) including site specific Resettlement Plan and Livelihood Restoration Plan (RPs and LRP). The client has prepared three draft ESIAs/ESMPs for the first batch of the sub-projects and those will be disclosed at the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and Bank’s websites in a timely manner and made available at project sites in hard copies.Environmental and Social Aspect. The Project is expected to generate positive E&S outcomes from integrated and improved waste management and reduced waste load to the environment. However, potential adverse E&S impacts of primary concern during project construction and operation include air pollutant emissions and disposal of hazardous wastes, such as fly ash from RDF burning and accidentally disposed medical and hazardous waste; treatment of leachate from landfill and waste compression; risk of fire and explosion caused by biogas from landfill, and during production, storage and transportation of fuel products; dust and bio-aerosols, odors, and vehicle emissions from waste receipt, unloading, processing, storage, and transport; noise and vibration from truck traffic, loading equipment, stationary compactors, balers, grinders, and other treatment and conveyance systems; community health and safety concerns including odor, traffic safety, workers' camps, and pollutant leakage. While the landfill is adjacent to residential and agricultural land, the impacts are site-specific and are not expected to cause significant harm to the nearby communities. Mitigation measures such as buffer zones will be added to ensure that any adverse effects are addressed. Other social issues are anticipated around the associated facilities, such as temporary landfill options and access roads. Mitigation measures are proposed in the ESIA/ESMP to address these impacts, including a site-specific LRP targeting scavengers, women, and other vulnerable groups will also be prepared. Any legal and physical footprints will be verified during site-specific ESIAs including possible E&S legacy issues, associated facilities, and project’s area of influence.Gender Aspect.The Project consulted and involved women and other vulnerable groups in the design, planning, delivery, and evaluation of the solid waste disposal sites that identified possible interventions to promote improved working conditions for women and vulnerable groups currently involved in waste collection, sorting, and disposal networks as well as facilitate gender inclusion in overall project operations. The Project engaged various stakeholders on a separate consultation with women and vulnerable groups during the appraisal and preparation of the first three ESIAs. To mitigate the adverse impact on women waste pickers, the project design includes a) provisions for women waste pickers to access benefits from the solid waste value chain b) support to business opportunities, c) training opportunities based on the results of a training needs assessment (TNA), and d) an increase percentage of women with access to services in solid waste management as workers. Entitlements for women will also be included, together with measures to address gender-based violence (GBV), sexual exploitation, abuse and sexual harassment (SEA/SH) are incorporated. In addition, a Gender Action Plan (GAP) will also be developed to address and prevent potential negative impacts on women. This plan aims to promote inclusion and equality, prevent GBV and SEA/SH.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.In addition to typical construction work-related OHS risks, existing risks that will continue to be relevant are: a) the waste pickers, landfill workers, and staff due to interactions with waste, exposure to dangerous gases such as methane, moving equipment, compost and RDF products and heavy machinery, leading to possible workplace accidents and injuries and health impacts from exposure to toxic waste, medical waste, fire and smoke, and pathogens; b) potential risk Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH) risks on communities due to possible labor influx; and c) child and women protection concerns on SEA/SH and Gender Based Violence (GBV) in light of the prevalence of women and children among waste pickers at the landfill. Measures to improve workplace safety for women and men through providing personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety training as well as improving security standards and protocols on landfill sites and waste facilities will be formulated to protect the workers and to be included in the site-specific ESMPs.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.Several consultations, discussions, and interviews have been carried out with key stakeholders, including relevant government units, project-affected people, local communities, women, waste pickers, other vulnerable groups, and other interested parties, during the preparation of the ESMPF and the first three site-specific ESIAs. The consultation process, including comments and suggestions received from stakeholders and how they are addressed, is documented in the E&S instruments. The Client has also prepared a separate Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP). The consultation process will continue and be expanded to facilitate meaningful consultation and provide opportunities for public participation during project implementation. The draft E&S instruments in English and summary in Bahasa Indonesia have been disclosed on October 30, 2024, by the client onMPW websiteand will be disclosed on the Bank's website before the deadline of disclosure as per AIIB ESP.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM): A multi-tier GRM will be established at the Project and subproject level for the Project Affected People (PAPs). A separate GRM for Project contracted workers will also be developed to receive and facilitate the resolution of the concerns or complaints of local communities, other stakeholders particularly women, vulnerable groups, and people who believe they have been adversely affected by E&S impacts of the Project. In addition to the above, GRM will be made available to address complaints from the local communities and workplace grievances. The Project-level GRM will be operational before any Project activities that require the GRM coverage are implemented. Information on established multi-tier GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) in local languages will at least be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner to communities surrounding the area of the project activities prior to implementation of the Project.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) will have the overall responsibility for project preparation, coordination, supervision, and monitoring of project including E&S impacts, and coordination with all 10 Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and submission of consolidated project implementation reports to AIIB. The CPMU will be supported by the National Project Management Consultant (NPMC) to assist in the implementation and monitoring of ESMPF, ESIAs, ESMPs and RPs, across all 10 project sites. They will also prepare E&S quarterly and bi-annual monitoring reports based on agreed format to be submitted to CPMU and AIIB.

EBRD has categorized the ES risks of the Projects as Category B, which is equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable.Environmental and Social Instruments. The Sponsor has prepared the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) including the management plans, non-technical summary of the ESIA (NTS), stakeholder engagement plan (SEP) and social compliance audit report (SCAR) for each one of two Solar PV projects and Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) for Banka Solar and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for Bilasuvar Solar. Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) for both projects have been carried out, and the Biodiversity Management Plans (BMPs) have also been prepared. Lenders’ Environmental and Social Advisor (LESA) hired by the Project carried out environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) and reviewed the project ES documents as well as the Sponsors’ ES management capacity and management systems. The ESDD report and environmental and social action plan (ESAP) have been prepared.Environmental Aspects. The environmental impacts associated with construction phase of the Project include generation of wastewater, noise and vibration, air quality deterioration due to gaseous emissions and dust, generation of solid waste and hazardous waste including the waste generated from broken/damaged solar panels and accidental spills and leaks. There are a few old structures at the sites, which might have material containing asbestos. Proper management measures will be included in the site-specific hazardous waste management plan, and only licensed and certified contractors will engage on the Project to handle such hazardous waste. Procedures will be developed and implemented for the storage, reuse, recycling, or disposal of damaged or unused solar PV panels. With respect to the impacts on biodiversity, the Banka Solar area partly overlaps an internationally recognized key biodiversity area (KBA), specifically the Kura Delta Important Bird Area (IBA). During the ESIA study, it was assessed that the portion of the Project area that overlaps the IBA consists purely of modified habitat, and there were no wetlands or waterbodies present within the area. CHA concluded that the development of Banka Solar will not adversely affect bird priority biodiversity features (PBFs), and no net loss will result from development of the Banka Solar to these PBFs. The Bilasuvar Solar area comes within 1 km of an internationally recognized KBA, specifically the Lake Mahmudchala IBA. The ESIA study and CHA concluded that the Project area is ecologically isolated, and effectively separated from this IBA, therefore, the Project is considered unlikely to generate a significant impact on the Lake Mahmudchala IBA, or the bird species that utilize it, and no net loss will result from development of the Bilasuvar Solar. The environmental impacts associated with the operation phase of the Project include generation of waste, occupational health and safety and disturbance to fauna. Operational phase environmental, health and safety management plans will be developed prior to the start of operation phase. Additionally, an 80-km 330-kV overhead transmission line (OHTL) which will connect the Banka Solar Project to the Navahi substation and a 90-km 330kV OHTL which will connect the Bilasuvar Solar Project to the Navahi substation are part of the AZURE Project. Both OHTLs are considered as associated facilities to the Project but those will be financed by the World Bank and an ESIA for that is under preparation. Although the GoA is responsible for developing the OHTL connecting the Project to the Navahi substation within the AZURE Project and since it is an associated facility to the AZURE Project, the World Bank's Environmental and Social Standards will apply to the OHTLs.Social aspects. The ESIA reports have identified resettlement and livelihood impacts created by the Project. The LRP has been developed to mitigate the economic displacement impacts that will be created for Banka Solar. The RAP has been developed to mitigate the potential physical and economic displacement impacts that will be created for Bilasuvar Solar. Also, Social Compliance Audit Report (SCAR) for Banka Solar and Bilasuvar Solar separately has been prepared to provide compensation packages for Project-affected peoples who faced past displacement impacts including proposed measures to mitigate and/or manage the impacts as part of a Corrective Action Plan on the Project-affected peoples and their households. The Banka Solar is located near the Caspian Sea, approximately 2 km from the coastline and 500 meters north of the Kura River. The Project site covers three separate land plots totaling approximately 973 hectares. These lands will be reclassified as “Renewable Energy Land Category” under the Ministry of Energy by a decree from the Prime Minister. The Bilasuvar Solar is located in the Bilasuvar district of the Shirvan-Salyan region in Azerbaijan, about 140 km south of Baku. The Project site covers one land plot of approximately 1,454 hectares, categorized as agricultural land and owned by the Bilasuvar Executive Power. The LRP studies have identified 14 Project-affected people, comprising 3 households (one formal herder and two workers) and part of the Project site was previously used for grazing by a herder and his two workers. The RAP studies have identified 12 project-affected households (PAHs). Of these, 11 households are informal users of the land, while only one household is a formal user. The LRP and RAP have been developed in consultation with affected households and local authorities to provide appropriate compensation and livelihood restoration as per EBRD PR5.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Labor and Working Condition.The OHS risks associated with construction activities include transportation and delivery of equipment and materials, use of heavy machinery, excavation works on the site, handling of chemicals, and works undertaken at height. A framework for construction stage OHS and environmental plan has been prepared. Site specific OHS management plans for the construction and operation phases of the Project will be developed and implemented by the EPC contractors. As the Project will be co-financed with EBRD and EBRD’s PRs AIIB will be followed in addressing potential issues regarding labor and working conditions. Enhanced supply chain due diligence has been conducted for the solar components, and compliance with EBRD ESP (including PR2) has been confirmed. The Sponsor has provided evidence of a functioning supply chain management system, including several policies and position statements stating that the Sponsor has a zero tolerance for labor violations. The supply chain for the Project up to Metallurgical Grade Silicon (MGS) (tier 5) has been confirmed through bills of materials and verified by an independent consultant. The finance documents and ESAP, once prepared, will require the Sponsor and the Borrower to maintain due diligence and management procedures for the sourcing of solar components in accordance with Good International Practice (GIP). Representations and warranties on labor and working conditions will be provided by Project contractors and suppliers and incorporated in key project agreements and contracts.Stakeholder Engagement, Information Disclosure and Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.Stakeholder mapping and consultations were conducted during the preparation of the ESIA. The draft ESIAs and associated documents, including NTS, SEPs, SCARs, RAP and LRP in English and NTS and SEP in Azerbaijani have been disclosed by the Masdar forBanka SolarandBilasuvar Solaron its website. The E&S documents have also been disclosed on theBank’s website. The Borrowers will establish two separate Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRMs) for each project, one for internal parties, i.e., construction and commissioning personnel, workers, and Project staff (including subcontractors); and the other for external parties, i.e., Project-affected peoples. The Borrowers will publish information on GRMs at the PV power plant-level for related stakeholders and Project-affected peoples including local communities in accordance with EBRD’s PR10 (Information Disclosure and Stakeholder Engagement) requirements. The EPC contractors will also be required to establish its GRM, and the contacts to access this GRM as well as the GRM at each one of two project-level and EBRD’s independent accountability mechanism will be disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements. Two Borrowers have been established in Azerbaijan and will be responsible for the implementation of the Project. The Borrowers will hire qualified ES staff to monitor the implementation of ES management plans. EPC contractors will also deploy ES staff to implement the ES management plans at the Project sites. LESA will be engaged to monitor the ESAP implementation during the construction and operation stages of the Project. Monitoring report will be prepared based on agreed format quarterly during construction, semi-annually during the first two years of operation and annually afterwards and that will be submitted to AIIB for review by the Borrower and LESA.

As part of project preparation, instruments, such as an ESIA and Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) should be prepared in parallel to other project documents, under the ESF. If some sub-projects are not identified or finalized at the time of project appraisal, instruments, such as an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), should be prepared to provide the technical guidance and procedural requirement for in environmental and social matters project implementation. The Borrower has assured that LWASA will use the AIIB’s ESF to guide their environmental and social due diligence and preparation of relevant instruments. LWASA has carried out preliminary due diligence including 3 environmental and social impact studies of the Project, in accordance with national policy and requirement. Overall the environmental and social impacts are expected to be positive as the works relate to the augmentation of the water supply systems, minimization of water losses, and reduction of deteriorating environmental impact of untreated sewage disposal in Lahore. An ESMF is under preparation. Guidance on Environmental and Social Assessment followed by preparation of a specific ESIA and Management Plans will be prepared as part of the ESMF. For each specific sub-project identified during the project preparation, the ESIA and the ESMP will be prepared. This will include consultation with relevant stakeholders, with a focus on project affected peoples (PAPs) and enabling women to actively participate, and adequate information disclosure.",USD235 million,Category A,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) will apply to the project. No Indigenous Peoples/Ethnic Minority groups are collectively attached to the project area. Therefore, ESS 3 Indigenous Peoples is not applicable, as per the Bank’s ESP.E&S Categorization and Rationale.Based on the available information, including several site missions by the project team and the studies associated with the robust assessments to prepare the E&S instruments, the project has been categorized as Category B. This is because the anticipated project Environmental and Social (E&S) risks and impacts are expected to be localized and of a temporary nature. The E&S risks and impacts are not unprecedented to the project area and can be mitigated through effective E&S management.Instruments.In 2019, MPWT prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF), and an Ethnic Groups Engagement Framework (EGEF) for the NR13 South project in accordance with AIIB safeguard policies. Considering that this project is located on the same road as the NR13 South project, these frameworks, and the latest version of the AIIB’s ESP (November 2022) were the basis for the Department of Roads to prepare the ESIA, Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), Resettlement Plan (RP) and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for this project. The E&S instruments were prepared and disclosed on the AIIB website in September 2023.Environment Aspects.During the rehabilitation stage, there will be some negative environmental impacts in the 20 km section where the road will be expanded from two to four lanes. On the other hand, the impacts are expected to be minimal in the remaining 30 km section, as the existing alignment will be utilized. The construction phase is likely to have negative environmental impacts, including noise, dust, and gas emissions. It may also involve the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, water contamination, siltation of water bodies, blockage of drainage, soil erosion and contamination, and removal of vegetation. Additionally, the ESIA has identified the need to fell at least 458 trees as part of the site preparation works. The trees are not considered part of a natural habitat and are mainly planted in private land lots or for ornamental purposes. The ESMP includes mitigation measures for the identified risks and adverse impacts including the preparation of a stand-alone OHS Management Plan for the project prior to the work commencement. The ESMP provides provision of tree transplantation, where possible, as well as compensatory planting. The ESMP also includes a monitoring plan, environmental code of practices, reporting mechanism, and roles and responsibilities of the key institutions for its implementation. A site-specific ESMP will be prepared by the contractor prior to the construction (C-ESMP).Land Acquisition and Resettlement.The project will not involve any physical relocation of permanent structure and/or involve major resettlement of people. The Detailed Measurement Survey (DMS) was conducted based on the confirmed COI from 16 January 2023 to 16 February 2023. The DMS indicates that the Project will affect 556 Project Affected Households (PAHs) comprising 3,078 Project Affected Persons (PAPs), including 1,371 females, across 21 villages in three districts and two provinces. About 12 housing structures of 12 PAHs will be affected. Among them, six are built on private-owned land while the other six are constructed on Government reserved-land requiring resettlement on their own land or government land nearby. About 82 shops will be considered as an entirely affected structure and will be fully compensated. Both PAHs for housing structures and shops will construct their new housing and/or shops within the existing land plot area covered in the land title/certificate. Other impacts involve secondary structures like porches of shops, gates, fences, signs, and drainage systems. A safety or buffer zone of 1.5 meters will be established.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The ESMP has identified OHS risks during the entire OPBRC contract period. The OHS requirements will be included in the contactor’s site-specific ESMP. Additionally, the ESMP addresses various other issues such as labor influx, working conditions, labor payments, inadequate sanitation facilities for women, labor disputes or grievances, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH), and code of conduct. The client will ensure that the bidding documents include clauses pertaining to these requirements. Furthermore, the client will oversee the contractors' compliance with applicable labor laws and regulations, as well as the adoption and enforcement of codes of conduct for all workers.Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI).Aligned with GoL’s efforts, a GESI Framework has been developed for the project with the aim to: (i) enhance the participation of women and vulnerable groups in project-related activities through public consultations at each phase of the project; (ii) provide women and vulnerable groups with road safety and accessibility measures; (iii) promote equal opportunities for female employment; and (iv) strengthen the technical capacity of MPWT staff. The GESI Framework outlines guiding principles for the effective incorporation of GESI considerations as an integral part of the proposed project.Stakeholder Consultation and Information Disclosure. Consultations were carried out during the conduct of E&S studies, the development of the ESMP; RP and SEP including the update of the ESIA. During the construction phase, the project implementation unit is required to regularly conduct consultations with local communities and report monthly. The E&S documentation were disclosed in English and Lao language at the MPWT websitehttps://mpwt.gov.la/en/singleProjectDetail/168on August 30, 2023 and Bank’s website on September 08, 2023.Project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been in operation and functioning since the implementation of the NR13 South project financed by AIIB. It will be further improved during the implementation of this project. The GRM covers four types of grievances and has been in place from pre-construction to the construction and operation of the project. These include grievances from: a) community members, including the public and other stakeholders; b) households affected by land acquisition, both those with land titles and those without; c) SEA/SH victims; and d) contractor's workers. Additionally, the project will utilize the existing GRM of the MPWT through the MPWT website, which allows for online feedback or complaint submission in Lao and English languages athttps://www.mpwt.gov.la/complaint.",,Category B,OK

ESS1 – Environmental and Social Assessment and Management and ESS2 – Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement; and ESS3: Indigenous Peoples are applicable. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project is classified as Category A, based on the environmental and social (ES) due diligence the Project carries risks associated with ongoing livelihood impacts to downstream communities and ethnic minority groups, critical habitats and internationally recognized areas for biodiversity conservation; aquatic biodiversity values; dam safety; river flows from power generation; and ES management systems.Environmental and Social Instruments.A third-party ES Due Diligence Report (ESDD) has been conducted. In addition, several ES instruments have been prepared such as: i) Environmental and Social Policy; ii) Community Development and Ethnic Minority Plan; iii) Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP); iv) Additional Assessment for Downstream and 230kV T-line of XKM1; v) Dam Safety Report; vi) Critical Habitat Assessment; vii) Environmental Flow (E-Flow) Assessment. Based on the ESDD, an ESCAP has been prepared to guide implementation of a series of measures to address outstanding ES issues and provide for monitoring and supervision of their implementation.Environmental Aspects.Xekaman 1 and Xekaman Xanxay are existing facilities situated in a remote upland area, characterized by dense natural terrain and in relatively close proximity to a number of protected forest areas. Key environmental considerations associated with the financing of this Project consist of, but not limited to, E-Flow and associated Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) and the ecology. The CHA was initially carried out to comply with the IFC Performance Standards and then subsequently further reviewed against the AIIB ESP. Based on this review, an ESCAP has been prepared, clearly setting out gaps to be closed and further studies to be undertaken, which includes a biodiversity action plan (BAP) to clearly outline the responsibilities for implementation of ecological mitigation measures during implementation. To facilitate this, and properly address the ES impacts upon AIIB financing, a Lenders ES Advisor (LESA) to be engaged by the Sponsor who will further review the E-flow assessments and the BAP undertaken and provided improvement measures to ensure implementation of the Project following AIIB ESP throughout the period of financing.Social Aspects.Based on the ESDD conducted previously, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was developed in 2012 and subsequently approved by the GoL and the land acquisition process was government-led per the Lao PDR laws and regulations. Compensation for assets on land was completed in 2012 while relocation of households to the two resettlement sites were completed in 2015 to 2017. All the Project-affected persons (PAPs) received resettlement assistance packages, including residential land with a house, agricultural land, relocation support, cash support to relocate graves, assistance to obtain Land Use Right Certificates, livelihood support assistance to vulnerable affected households, and other support to maintain traditional customs in the new resettlement sites. The agreed ESCAP has specified some issues that need further actions of the Project’s Sponsor on (review the effectiveness of the provided livelihood restoration supports for affected households, due diligence on the impacts of the transmission lines, coordinate with local authority and relevant government agencies to complete granting of land use right certificates for the lands of relocation households, etc.) – the LESA, once engaged-will support the Project’s Sponsor in implementing and monitoring of the required actions.Ethnic Minorities.The presence of Ethnic Minorities in the Project area was assessed as meeting the AIIB’s ESS 3 criteria for Indigenous Peoples. It was determined that ethnic minority groups (Talieng, Yae, Harak, Brao, Brou) have an ancestral presence in the Project area and meet the definition of Indigenous Peoples as per AIIB’s ESS3. It was confirmed during the social due diligence that the Sponsor has obtained Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) through several consultation meetings with the identified ethnic minorities, which have been well-documented. The Project developed a Community Development and Ethnic Minority Plan to minimize the Project's impact on these communities and mitigate the impact on the livelihoods of ethnic minority people in the affected area, considering their development needs and aspirations. It also includes support for traditional customs and culture, ceremonial assistances, in-kind support for vulnerable people in the resettlement site, and funding for gender development programs in Xanxay and Xaysetha districts, among others. The remaining activities will be continued during the operation phase as part of the ESMP. The Project will implement the remaining activities in a culturally appropriate manner as a component of a broader community development plan as discussed in the SEP.Gender Aspects.During the ESDD conducted, the gender participation was high during consultations and focused-group discussions. At least 20 focus group discussions were organized, including women groups. Based on the surveys conducted, the Land Use Right Certificates issued by the GoL reflect the names of female and male heads of the resettled household. Also, national laws and policies in Lao PDR support gender equality, women’s empowerment, and participation in economic, social, and political arenas. The ESCAP will facilitate a gender-inclusive and responsive approach during Project implementation, particularly in the implementation of SEP. Moreover, measures for mitigating the gender-based violence (GBV) risks and provision of community-level benefits to the identified difficulties faced by women will be further monitored during the implementation of the ESCAP.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Working Conditions.The ESDD also assessed occupational health and safety (OHS) as well as labor and working conditions (LWC). The associated risks related to OHS are for the operations, not the construction. Risk assessment and occupational health and safety procedures1are well prepared and implemented by the Project’s Sponsor. Workers at the sites are provided with suitable PPE and annual OHS trainings.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Several consultation meetings, key informant interviews with PAPs and nearby communities, focus group discussions, meetings with local authorities including national agencies were conducted in the preparation of the ES documents. No complaint about the information transparency was recorded. A SEP was prepared that assessed the impacts on and influence of these various stakeholders, formulate differentiated approaches and strategies for engaging with them in a meaningful and culturally appropriate way, and specify the roles and responsibilities of project management and implementation units in implementing the SEP throughout the whole process of Project implementation. The consultation process, including comments and suggestions received from stakeholders and how they are addressed, were documented in the ES instruments. The ES instruments in English were disclosed on the Bank’s website in early 2023. The Executive Summary of the revised and updated ES instruments including the ESCAP was translated into Lao language are disclosed at Viet Lao website and AIIB’s websites.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.The Project utilizes the existing grievance redress mechanism (GRM) of the GoL at the local and village level to address grievances of PAPs effectively and promptly. Additionally, the Project will utilize the existing GRM of the Viet Lao Power Company through their website, which allows for online feedback or complaint submission in Lao, Vietnamese and English at https://vietlaopower.com/en/tin-tuc/xekaman-1-power/complaint-resolution-procedure-at-xekaman-1-hydropower-project-897.html. Information about the GRM will be disseminated along with AIIB's Project-affected People's Mechanism (PPM) through the disclosure of ES documentation.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The Sponsor will hire and mobilize a LESA to undertake quarterly monitoring of the ES performance of the Project and review progress made against the ESCAP and commitments made in the financing agreement. The Sponsor will also submit quarterly monitoring for the first year and semi-annual for the succeeding year of Project duration. In addition, the Bank’s ES specialists will carry out semi-annual supervision mission in the field and continue providing support and monitor Project’s compliance with the Bank’s ESP and as per agreed ESCAP.",,Category A,OK

It consists of three key components: (i) financing 500,000 off-grid solar pumps over the next five years; (ii) strengthening the distribution system by upgrading equipment such as transformers, breakers, and feeders to optimize power distribution and accommodate the increasing influx of solar energy; and (iii) providing technical assistance and capacity building to enhance the capacity of the implementing agency and beneficiaries to deliver consistent benefits.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.The Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will be applicable to this Program. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been categorized as Category C because the potential environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts to be low and limited. However, a screening process will be designed as part of Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA), this assessment reviews the adequacy of the systems proposed to be applied to the RBP for managing ES risks and potential impacts, including the Client’s capacity to plan, implement, monitor, and report on ES mitigation measures, scope for improvements, and risks and related mitigation measures.Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts. No major environmental impacts and risks are envisaged during the construction stage. The only risk associated with the program is disposal of damaged solar panels. It will be discussed with the client to put a mechanism in place to ensure that supplier takes back the damaged panels at the time of replacement.  The social impacts and risks are expected to be low and private land acquisition is not envisaged. The pumps will be installed on beneficiary farmer’s land; upgrading of equipment like transformers, breakers, and feeders will be in the existing substations; and setting up small solar-powered grids in strategic spots across Maharashtra will be on government owned land free of encroachment and other encumbrances.Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA). ESSA is a prerequisite under RBP financing, will be conducted to assess the adequacy of the environment and social systems. The program will leverage the experience of other relevant projects to mainstream environmentally and socially friendly practices. It aims to be gender responsive, socially inclusive, and transparent. MSEDCL already has a functional grievance redress system as the project-level grievance redress mechanism (GRM) that will be reviewed during appraisal to ensure that the mechanism addresses complaints associated with, amongst others, access to information and stated benefits. ESSA will further recommend actions, if required, to strengthen specific aspects of the MSEDCL’s capacity and these systems for mitigating ES risks during the preparation and implementation of the RBP including issues related to gender and social exclusion.Stakeholder Engagement, Information Disclosure, and Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.AIIB’s ES specialists and consultants will carry out further desktop and field-based ES screening and assessment during appraisal and hold consultations with program stakeholders to enable informed ES management systems assessment. The draft assessment will be publicly disclosed timely in an appropriate manner before appraisal of the RBP. MSEDCL already has a functional grievance redress system as the project-level grievance redress mechanism (GRM). The information of this GRM and the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of AIIB will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner. The ES actions to fill any gaps identified will be agreed upon with the MSEDCL prior to program approval.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.Proposed ES action implementation will be monitored and reported based on agreed format during program implementation. Bank will conduct monitoring and supervision during program implementation and providing implementation support to the Client as appropriate.","USD1,100 million",Category C,OK

The Project has been prepared consistent with the Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable for the Project. ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) and ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) are not triggered, as project activities will not cause involuntary resettlement and no Indigenous Peoples are present in, or have collective attachment to, the Project area. The Project is assigned Category A, in accordance with the ESP due to large-scale construction activities and expected significant adverse noise-related environmental and social impacts.Instruments.Based on national regulations, the Project Implementation Agency (PIA) prepared an Environmental and Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) for the overall airport development activities which includes the Project activities. The EHIA includes Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) for the potential E&S risks and impacts during the construction and operational phases in the areas of noise pollution, air emissions, wastewater, traffic, labor and occupational health and safety risks. The EHIA contains elaborate documentation of the multiple rounds of consultations held with the Project-Affected People (PAP). While the EHIA is assessed to be largely aligned with ESF requirements, a standalone Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), Noise Compensation and Management Framework (NCMF) have been developed and disclosed on July 1, 2022. The NCMF will guide the preparation of detailed compensation plans for those affected by the increased noise exposure during the airport operations. The NCMF includes the noise-mitigation process outlined in the EHIA and provides measures to support PAP, mainly - vulnerable owners. NCMF provides details on enumeration of assets, valuation process, negotiation process together with timelines and institutional arrangements.Environmental Aspects.The potential environmental impacts resulting from the Project activities during the implementation and operation are increased noise, disposal of solid waste, and generation of wastewater. Based on the EHIA and biodiversity assessment, the impacts on avifauna are low. For the construction phase, the Project will have conventional construction-related risks and impacts manifested through dust emissions, water contamination, noise, removal of construction debris, etc. The increased flight traffic will gradually exacerbate existing noise exposure levels which are expected to peak by 2048. The air quality assessment and noise studies use annual flight data classified by aircraft type in each route. Predictions are presented in terms of Noise Exposure Forecast (NEF), a widely recognized noise metric used extensively for land use planning and assessing community response to aircraft noise. Buildings, including sensitive receptors are classified as significantly, moderately, or low impacted. The noise assessment, mitigation and management measures set out in the EHIA are broadly in line with IFC guidance and international standards. With respect to Climate Change aspects, the Project aligns with Thailand’s National Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS) as well as a seminal methodology in development in AIIB, based on the MDB Joint Methodology for Paris Agreement alignment.Social Aspects.The construction and operation of the Project is confined within the territory of the existing airport and no additional land is required. Owners whose properties fall within the NEF ≥ 40 and 30-40 contours will be eligible for compensation to implement mitigation measures. In NEF ≥ 40 areas, which are assessed to be 14.30 sq km, the PIA shall negotiate to buy land and properties constructed before the date the EHIA Report is approved by National Environment Board (NEB). The PIA will provide the financial amount to cover the renovation cost to reduce noise impact to those landowners who do not consider selling. Owners of properties and sensitive receptors located in the area exposed to NEF 30 – 40 (spread in 48.25 sq km area) will be provided with compensation to undertake mitigation measures to reduce the noise impact. While the NEF identified areas and receptors are based on peak noise impact for 2048, the compensation will be available the compensation is expected to be available from 2024, well before impact is experienced by the communities. The EHIA also commits the PIA to establish a Foundation to provide additional financial support for affected people and communities. Project activities during the construction phase involve typical construction risks that will be mitigated according to management plans, to be prepared by contractors in line with the frameworks defined in the EHIA. The contractors will also adopt an appropriate Code of Conduct, including relevant procedures to identify and prevent gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and sexual harassment. A gender assessment of the project was carried out and as a result a Gender Inclusion Strategy was adopted by the PIA.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The draft EHIA was subjected to three rounds of public consultations, as required by the Thai regulations. Additional consultations in person and online were organized to clarify a revision in the predicted number of severely affected properties. The full EHIA with summaries (in Thai) were disclosed on the dedicated Project’swebsiteand are available on site. The EHIA, NCF and SEP (in Thai and English) are made available on AIIB Projects’website.Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The PIA has organized a complaints-handling mechanism covering the EHIA preparation, construction, and operational phases. This mechanism consists of multiple entry points and channels. A Monitoring Committee for the construction phase will be established, which will include representatives from the affected communities, relevant governmental agencies and the PIA. This Committee will accept complaints from the project affected people (PAP) and construction workers. During the operation phase, a dedicated Environmental Impact Mitigation Coordination Center will be established to address complaints related to functioning airport. Bank will periodically assess and assist the PIA in strengthening the Grievance Mechanism.",,Category A,OK

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project is classified as Category B, considering most of the environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts from reconstruction and rehabilitation works are temporary, short-term, limited, site-specific, reversible, and can be effectively mitigated with known measures and sound management practices. ESS1 – Environmental and Social Assessment and Management and ESS2 – Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement are applicable. ESS3 – Indigenous Peoples is not applicable in Türkiye since Indigenous Peoples are not present in the country.Environmental and Social Instruments.In line with Section VI, E, Item 53 of ESP, the use of a phased approach for ES assessment is adopted for this Project given the urgent need of assistance because of the earthquakes. KGM hired ES consultants to carry out the Environmental and Social Impacts Assessment (ESIA) for the Project, including a) an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) on the subprojects under construction, which contains Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) for each subproject detailing the required actions to fill the gaps identified and rectify any critical safety concerns and/or legacy issues; b) Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for each subproject to be integrated into the respective civil works contract; c) a Resettlement Plan (RP) outlining principles and guidance on the identification and management of resettlement impacts during Project implementation; d) a Gender Action Plan (GAP) including specific gender considerations to be taken into account during the Project implementation and monitoring indicators; e) a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) defining a program for stakeholder engagement, including Project-specific grievance redress mechanism (GRM), public information and consultations throughout the Project cycle.Environmental Aspect.The project is expected to bring environmental benefits by improving traffic safety in targeted regions through enhanced infrastructure that is safer, more sustainable, and resilient to disasters. Potential adverse environmental effects are not expected to be significant, and may include soil erosion, loss of surface vegetation, dust, noise, waste disposal, communities and wildlife disturbance, and traffic disruptions during construction, along with road and traffic safety issues during operation.The ESIA carried out a comprehensive survey of the biological environmental baseline and assessment of the Project’s potential impacts to habitats and species. Although some of the roads intersect with or are situated adjacent to areas with important biodiversity value, given the existing nature and surrounding urbanization, the impact of rehabilitation works in these areas is not expected to be significant. Precautionary mitigation and monitoring measures are proposed in the ESMPs to avoid or minimize disturbance. The ESDD did not identify any legacy environmental issues, but areas for improvement include the provision of sufficient temporary waste storage area, prevention of oil spills during maintenance works, remediation of unsafe site conditions, additional training needs, and timely obtainment of required environmental permits, which are proposed as corrective actions in the ESAP.Social Aspect.The ESDD did not identify any social legacy issues. Aspects for improvement identified and included as corrective actions in the ESAP comprise the establishment of project-specific Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM), appointing a stakeholder engagement and project-specific GRM expert, preparation and use of the Chance Find Procedure for cultural management and additional training requirements. The social impacts, such as land use, cultural heritage, community and occupational health and safety, labor and working conditions, affected stakeholders and livelihoods, are addressed in ESMPs for each sub-project. An economic displacement of 915 m2is required for the land belonging to 12 title holders for the rehabilitation of the Antakya-Samandağ Road (P3). For Tohma Bridge within subproject P5, land for a temporary campsite including a 2-storey house structure has been rented from a private landowner. The RP outlining principles and providing guidance regarding identification and management of resettlement impacts during Project implementation is under review and will be disclosed by KGM prior to disbursement.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS).The Project will present typical civil works related to OHS risks such as collisions with moving machinery and vehicles, hazards from handling chemicals, electric shock, mechanical and load handling risks, exposure to noise, dust, and vapors. The ESMPs address these risks with measures to protect health and safety, and incorporate guidelines on environmental and social aspects, including GRM, gender equality and anti-discrimination measures, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH) prevention, labor rights, and freedom of association, ensuring all Project activities minimize disruptions and safeguard workers.Stakeholder Engagement. Stakeholder engagement was conducted through public consultation, focusing on various groups, including women and vulnerable populations, to inform the preparation of the ES instruments.  These consultations will continue throughout the Project cycle. During the ESDD preparation, meetings with the Mukhtars (village heads) and business owners highlighted concerns such as dust, noise, vibration, community health and safety, and traffic management. These concerns have been addressed by integrating appropriate mitigation measures into the ESMPs. The SEP includes provisions for overall management and coordination, disclosure, and meaningful consultations during SEP implementation.Gender Aspects.According to the ESDD evaluations, the Project does not cause discriminatory or negative gender impacts and does not include conditions that could lead to gender inequality. A GAP has been developed to operationalize recommendations on gender equality, manage risks, and promote gender opportunities, drivers of change, and positive gender dynamics throughout the Project’s life cycle, in accordance with national legislation and AIIB's ESF. The GAP addresses issues related to gender-based violence, gender inclusion, and ensures the implementation of a gender-sensitive GRM during the Project activities.Information Disclosure and Monitoring Arrangement.Under the phased approach, the draft ESDD in English and its summary in Turkish, including the ESAP, was disclosed by KGM on April 5, 2024 (Link) (Link); and disclosed on AIIB’s website on April 10, 2024 (Link) (Link). The final ESDD with ESAP, ESIA, ESMPs, SEP and GAP were disclosed by KGM inJuly or August 2024. One environmental and one social specialist have been assigned to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and to each Regional Implementation Unit (RIU). As part of their responsibilities, they will monitor the ESAP and ESMP implementation across all subprojects and provide semi-annual ES monitoring reports to the Bank based on agreed format, and the Bank will carry out field-based ES supervision during implementation.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The existing KGM’s GRM and site-level GRMs for Project-affected People (PAP) and workers involved in the subprojects under construction, have been evaluated as part of the ESDD. Based on the assessment result, Project-level and subproject-level GRMs for receiving and facilitating resolution of the concerns or complaints from the local community or the workers are described in the SEP and ESMPs to comply with AIIB's ESP requirements. The Project-level GRM and subproject-level GRM for subprojects under construction including the information of Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) have been disclosed in an appropriate manner in August 2024.",,Category B,OK

The proposed Project will have (i) general ES impacts and risks of the Project which are minor and localized, (ii) impacts which are expected to be reversible and temporary in nature, and (iii) impacts which can be effectively managed using practical and mature mitigation measures.Environmental and Social Instruments.JBM had conducted an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) based on JBM’s existing Environment and Social Management System (ESMS) and an environment and social compliance audit on JBM’s past and current performance against the objectives, principles and requirements of ADB’s SPS (2009). Following the identification of risks and gaps, an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) has been developed to address the identified ES risks & gaps.Environmental Aspects.The loan proceeds will be used to purchase electric buses (e-buses) and installation of associated charging infrastructure. The Project will reduce fossil fuel consumption, pollution, and increase energy efficiency of public transport. The agreed ESAP is expected to develop an ES management plan (ESMP) to address the potential ES impacts of civil and electrical infrastructure during the installation and operation stages such as air pollution, noise generation, effluent generation due to bus cleaning and washing, domestic activities at site; waste generation and management such as battery waste, e-waste, plastic waste, used tyres (rubber waste) hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste.Climate Risks and Opportunities.The Project is universally aligned under the mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement (BB1) and given the mobile nature of the assets financed, the physical climate risk of the Project is considered immaterial and thus, the Project can be considered aligned under the adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement (BB2).Social and Gender Aspects.Existing and new land parcels owned by transport authority will be used to develop new depots. The bus Operator License with the State Transport Undertaking (STU) partner includes the parking space license agreement which provides the operator the right to use and the right of way to the bus parking space. In compliance with ADB’s SPS on Involuntary Resettlement, a resettlement framework has been developed to anticipate potential involuntary resettlement (IR) impacts of the depot land allocation for the Project which may include informal land users and structures, temporary access restrictions and economic displacement of informal businesses around the depot area during construction/renovation.

The Fund adopts an Environmental, Social, and Governance Framework (ESGF) in congruence with AIIB's Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs), and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL). Subject to a prior review of the initial investments, AIIB will delegate to the Fund the selection, categorization, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of the Fund's further investments in subprojects, according to the Fund´s investment guidelines. The Fund's approximate pipeline will be aligned with the AIIB's sector strategies and geographies.Environment and Social Management System (ESMS).The Fund's Exclusion List is adequate to AIIB's ESEL and includes activities involving directly affect indigenous or tribal populations without full documented consent. The Fund's current ESGF is based on IFC's Performance Standards, incorporating ESG, climate, gender, and inclusion aspects within the investment cycle. The Fund screens investments based on an exclusion list and targets sectoral alignment (VICC Taxonomy Tool). After these two steps, the Fund measures the potential investment's exposition to ESG risks, such as resource scarcity, floods, and interference with indigenous people and areas of cultural significance, by answering a set of questions related to the economic activity and contextual issues of the Project (e.g., location), and then categorizes investments as A (High Risk), B+ (Medium-High Risk), B (Medium), and C (Low Risk) levels based on the IFC categorization scheme and its High-Risk Sectors List. In addition, AIIB will require the Fund to furnish detailed E&S due diligence (ESDD) assessments and instruments for the Bank's prior review and approval for all Category A and higher-risk subprojects for inclusion in AIIB’s financing.Environmental and Social Aspects.The Fund will invest in a portfolio of assets in the renewables (e.g., wind power and solar power), water and sewage, transmission, energy efficiency, and clean energy sectors (e.g., green hydrogen) in various regions in Brazil.

The gaps identified as part of the ESDD have been addressed through the ESAP, which includes a social impact assessment, resettlement plan, stakeholder engagement, and monitoring plan. The ESIA and RP has been prepared but implementation is yet to begin. A female management procedure has been established by the Project, which covers gender equality, security assurance, promotion, and training. The female management procedure contains a clear description of female labor rights to provide a safe and fair environment in the workplace. The ESIA will include an analysis of the potential impacts of the Project on women and recommend actions to mitigate the impacts, including the concerns related to gender-based violence (GBV). A gender action plan (GAP) will be prepared accordingly.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The ESDD assessed health and safety risks to the Project workers and the Project-affected communities and suggested measures to prevent accidents, injuries, and diseases. The measures include a site-specific labor influx management plan, a workers’ camp management plan, a traffic management plan, and an occupational, health and safety plan for both construction and operational phases.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure.The Project has undertaken consultation with the host community and the project-affected persons (PAPs). YIST will continuously engage and consult with various stakeholders, including women, throughout the Project cycle by implementing a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) to be outlined in the Resettlement Plan. The ES instruments including ESAP will be disclosed on both the Client’s and AIIB’s websites. The printed versions in Chinese will be made available in the Project area.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A Project-specific GRM will be established that will receive, acknowledge, evaluate, and facilitate resolutions of complaints related to the ES issues along with the proposed corrective actions. The YIST already has a functional GRM for workers, and therefore, a new GRM for workers is not required. The information of established GRM and Bank’s Project-affected People's Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangements.The Project’s ES issues, including the implementation of ES instruments, will be monitored by a qualified and experienced third party. This third party will prepare a biannual E&S monitoring report for the first two years based on agreed format and annually until the final maturity date.

AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) including Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) will apply to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are triggered by the Project. Key adverse environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts relate to air, soil, water, biodiversity; presence of cultural heritage sites within the Area of Impact; civil works induced impacts; natural hazards; occupational health and safety; community health and safety due to labor influx and presence of security personnel; and associated gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) risks to workers and communities during construction and operations phases. However, based on the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) study, the adverse E&S risks and impacts are small in scale, temporary and limited to the Project area, which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to relevant ESSs and good international practices, therefore, the Project is assigned Category B.Environmental and SocialInstruments.An ESIA Report, including the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), has been developed for the Project. In addition, a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP), Labor Management Plan (LMP), Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), Biodiversity Monitoring Plan (BMP), Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP), Community Health and Safety Management Plan (CHSMP), Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP), Waste Management Plan, Traffic Management Plan, and several other sub-management plans have been prepared in support of the project’s E&S Management System.Environmental Aspects.The Project area is a natural habitat with status as pastureland. The Project area is not located in and around any Key Biodiversity Assessment (KBA) and protected areas. Potential environmental impacts will include noise, dust, vibration, traffic safety, construction waste and wastewater generated during project construction and operation periods but can be mitigated through ESMP implementation. The Project layout was redesigned to avoid two archaeological sites in the northeast corner. The planned access road also includes construction of a bridge to mitigate the Project impact on another culture heritage—the Issos Ancient Waterway. The Project has prepared and will implement the Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP) to minimize and mitigate impacts on the existing culture heritages. During the construction phase, occupational, health and safety (OHS) risks may arise from excavation, height works, installation of cables and solar panels, backfilling, and use of heavy-duty vehicles. Such OHS risks and impacts will be managed and mitigated by the measures incorporated in the OHS Management Plan, EPRP and Traffic Management Plan prepared for the Project.Social and Gender Aspects.The Project will acquire approximately 200 ha of public pastureland belonging to the local municipality. There are no buildings within the Project site and around it. The ESIA survey and consultations confirmed that no economic impacts or physical displacement were expected, and no legacy issues were stated. The ESIA assessed the Borrower’s capacity to manage risks related to labor and working conditions under contractor and supplier contracts, including Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) suppliers and construction contractors to be engaged in the Project and confirmed its compliance with the ESP labor provisions.

AIIB has reviewed ADB’s SPS and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP including AIIB's Environmental and Social Exclusion List and relevant Environmental and Social Standards; and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the project.The GoKP has prepared a total of four draft Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for the solid waste management sub-projects, eight Initial Environmental Examinations (IEEs) for water supply, sanitation and sewage treatment plants (STPs) and nine stand-alone Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for green urban space sub-projects, which are all categorized as Category C sub-projects. A consolidated Social Due Diligence Report (SDDR) was prepared to screen all the activities for land acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement (IR) impacts. Fourteen of the 24 activities do not cause any Land Acquisition and Resettlement (LAR) impacts or social risks.The Project is expected to have positive environmental benefits as the subprojects will reduce urban pollution and prevent soil and water contamination. Urban green space interventions will enhance the urban quality with a range of environmental benefits. The adverse environmental impacts due to large-scale construction at multiple geographic locations will be avoided or minimized through appropriate design. Measures to mitigate the remaining impacts are included in the EMPs. The Project adopts viable climate adaptation measures into the designs.Seven activities out of 24 subprojects require acquisition of approximately 91 acres of private land comprising of about 21 acres of agriculture and about 70 acres waste/barren land. A total of 117 acres of land has already been acquired by the government for another three activities; 115 acres of which is barren land. However, Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are being prepared to address legacy issues and ensure that these activities are compliant with requirements of the ADB’s SPS. A Gender Action Plan (GAP) has been prepared. The Project directly addresses gender equity through women’s participation in urban governance.Consultation meetings were held with a wide range of stakeholders and the community views were incorporated into the ES documentation as well as subproject designs. All of the ES documents have been disclosed on the websites ofADB. andGoKPsince February 2021. GoKP will have the Executive Summaries of the ES documentation in Urdu language at the same website.

It will finance (i) the design and build of a viaduct structure, stations, and tracks; and (ii) the procurement and installation of systems, including signaling, telecommunications, auxiliary main substation, traction and power supply facilities.","E&S Policy (including Standards) and Categorization.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will apply to this project. ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable. In addition, the project activities are mainly within urban areas where no ethnic minority groups are collectively attached, therefore, ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not triggered. The project has been categorized as Category “A” based on the potential environmental and social (E&S) impacts due to civil works in a densely urbanized environment, land acquisition, occupational health, and safety (OHS), vehicular traffic, pollution, dust, noise, and vibration.Instruments.An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), together with an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and four social impact assessments (SIAs)/resettlement plans (RPs) were prepared by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) to meet international lender’s requirements. These documents adequately address the project risks and impacts, consultations, and management approaches, albeit with minor gaps. To meet AIIB ESP, (i) an Environmental Due Diligence Report (EDDR), covering the Climate Risk Assessment, Noise and Vibration (N&V) Assessment, institutional arrangements, and mitigation plans, and (ii) a Social Due Diligence Report (SDDR) were also prepared.Environmental Aspects.The project is anticipated to yield environmental benefits, notably reducing air pollution from traffic congestion. There is no forest area or notified eco-sensitive zone within 500 m of the proposed right-of-way (ROW). No wildlife habitat or notified eco-sensitive zone under Wildlife Act of 1972 is present within the 10 km radius area of proposed ROW, except for the Managlavanam Bird Sanctuary, which is present at 3 km from the JLN Station. The project activities are assessed to have no adverse risks and impacts on the Sanctuary, as it is already surrounded by extensive urban activity and the construction or operation stages of the project will not lead to no additional negative impact. During the construction phase, other negative impacts of the project will be temporary and reversible, including air pollution, N&V and the disposal of construction residues, which will be addressed as per the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). During the operational stage, N&V impacts are assessed to be within the guidelines, however a set of measures to mitigate and minimize them was proposed, integrated into the designs, considered in the financing plan, and provision in ESMP will be made to ensure that this aspect is closely monitored during implementation and the operation stage. A traffic management plan has already been developed.Social Aspects.The project's design predominantly aligns with existing road medians to minimize the acquisition of private and public lands. However, acquisitions will be needed for station entry/exit points, and viaducts at certain locations, which are already well advanced. The land acquisition is being carried out in four stages for a total area of 4.05 Ha, which is linearly distributed across the 11.2 km length in multiple parcels. SDDR concluded that the process was well publicized, and the project affected people (PAPs) as well as communities are well aware of the project, entitlements and grievance channels. In addition, the due diligence identified 16 action points regarding social aspects, including requesting the Government for indexation of rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) compensation, gender, labor and working conditions, livelihoods, ongoing monitoring and supervision, and an action plan was agreed. A Livelihoods Support Plan is included in SDDR, which will be further enhanced based on the additional needs identified during project implementation.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The statutory process of SIA requires extensive consultation at various levels, including mandatory public consultations. During EIA, SIAs/RPs, EDDR, and SDDR preparation, KMRL/the Government of Kerala (GOK) consulted potential PAPs. EIA, the four SIAs/RPs, EDDR and SDDR are disclosed in English (with summaries in Malayalam) on KMRL’s website (atlink1andlink2) and AIIB’s website.Community, OHS, Labor and Employment Conditions.KMRL will stipulate and monitor adequate health and safety measures for the workers, and tendering documents include requirements on how contractors will address health and safety requirements. EDDR includes OHS provisions as well as templates for the OHS management. As the project’s works will be implemented in dense urban areas, mostly within the median of existing roads and in proximity to residential properties, measures will be included with specific focus on traffic management, community health and safety. Contractors will be required to submit site specific Community Health and OHS Management Plans for review and approval by KMRL before works commencement.Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Aspects.KMRL has implemented significant gender actions, that include women employment not only in the management, but also as train operators, station controllers, or engineers. Through Kudumbashree, KMRL engaged transgender staff in facility management services at stations such as housekeeping, security and ticketing. Phase II possesses the potential to make a significant contribution towards the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. The project is anticipated to promote social inclusion as it seeks to address in its design the access issues of marginalized and vulnerable groups. Potential incidents of sexual harassment at the workplace within KMRL would be addressed by an internal committee, which also conducts regular sessions with staff on women safety at workplace.Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).KMRL has existing customer care, grievance channels and management processes. Grievance/feedback submission channels for workers contracted under the project, citizens and KMRL’s employees include (i) a toll-free helpline, (ii) written feedback forms (available at stations’ customer cares), (iii) an email, (iv) a WhatsApp chat bot, (v) social media channels, (vi) station controller mobiles, and (vii) Metro Promo Center. KMRL has an established escalation process for addressing complaints received from these channels. For Phase II, the GRM is already functioning with a structure, which has been further strengthened by taking into account the lessons learnt from Phase I. A dedicated grievance form is made available for Phase II on KMRL’s website (link). Land acquisition and compensation-related grievances are addressed by the competent district authority for the implementation of overall land acquisition, awards, and payment of compensation. Locally appropriate public consultation and disclosure processes were and will be used to disseminate information about the GRM and AIIB’s Policy on the Project-affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM).Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.KMRL will be responsible for overall coordination, supervision, and monitoring of the project’s E&S aspects. KMRL will submit semi-annual E&S monitoring reports (based on an agreed format) to AIIB during project implementation. An independent third-party monitoring agency will verify project E&S compliance and report every six months. The project team will carry out field-based E&S supervision during implementation.",,Category A,OK

The Project is assigned as Category FI under the ESP as it involves on-lending through a Financial Intermediary (FI). The Project’s current pipeline has been mutually agreed and is aligned with the Bank’s sector strategies.Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS).The instrument to be applied by VPBank is their ESMS which is developed with assistance from International Finance Corporation (IFC) and follows the IFC Performance Standards (PS). The ESMS encompasses scoping, screening, categorization, risk assessment, development of mitigation action plans, project monitoring and supervision at the time of implementation of sub-projects financed. The ESMS will include provisions on addressing involuntary resettlement, adverse impacts on indigenous peoples and/or vulnerable groups, significant or cumulative risks to or impacts on the environment and social (ES), community health and safety, biodiversity and cultural resources, significant retrenchment, significant occupational health, and safety risks. Further enhancement of the ESMS will be required with regards to (i) integration of physical climate risk assessment of investments under ES Due Diligences (ESDD); (ii) adequate information disclosure in compliance with the Bank’s ESF for Category A and higher risk Category B sub-projects; (iii) integration of due diligence in relation to Labor and Working Conditions (LWC). The sub-loan beneficiaries will be bound to implement an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) to remediate any material gap with the applicable E&S standards defined in the VPBank’s ESMS within an agreed period. AIIB will require prior review of some sub-projects (first three and all higher risk sub-projects) to facilitate the VPBank’s compliance with AIIB’s ESP requirements.Environmental and Social Aspects:The Project’s proceeds will be used for on-lending to private entities, as defined by AIIB’s procurement policy, as per eligibility criteria designed after considering VPBank’s current pipeline of sub-projects. Both greenfield and brownfield projects are under consideration. The broad range of companies under proposed sectors present various significant ES risks that will be managed and mitigated using VPBank’s ESMS. VPBank will use AIIB’s proceeds for projects where land acquisition is conducted on market principles and where no legacy litigation cases are present. Therefore, ESS2 will not be triggered. For sub-project investments in locations affecting indigenous peoples, ESS3 will apply. Port projects present ES impacts in the form of air, water and soil pollution, possible impacts on biodiversity in relation to any expansion of port facilities, noise impacts, water pollution due to fuel leakage and impacts related to associated facilities such as road, rail transportation and/or storage facilities. The waste to energy plants present ES risks in the form of solid waste management, methane generation, water pollution, air pollution, and hazardous waste.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Working Conditions.The ESMS includes requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all sub-project activities that pose risks to contracted workers, communities, employees and may also have the potential for disruption of site works. In addition, all suppliers and contractors for sub-borrowers will be advised of the importance of implementing appropriate management measures to identify and address issues related to the ES provisions of the ESMS, including LWC and health and safety matters. The compliance with the ESMS is an essential part of the contract document with suppliers and contractors for each sub-project.Gender.Gender is an important theme and an integral part of the VPBank’s corporate policies. VPBank confirms that gender inclusion is an integral part of corporate policies and processes set up by VPBank. VPBank is monitoring gender balance among its labor force, and particularly at mid/high management level and aims for more gender-balanced management representation. At present, the overall female to overall staff ratio is 59 percent whereas the same at mid/top management is 52 percent. Human resource policies accommodate gender sensitive provisions for internal grievances. In addition to formal policies, VPBank applies a gender sensitive approach to many aspects of internal processes. This encompasses induction training on gender inclusion and opportunities for staff or contractors, trainings on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH), and prevention from any form of discrimination.Climate Risk and Opportunities.Upon discussion with the Bank, VPBank has agreed to amend its ESMS to incorporate provisions related to screening of sub-projects for exposure to physical climate risks as part of the due diligence process. Where the sub-projects are found exposed to climate hazards at a level of high risk, the sub-borrowers will be required to address the risks and integrate risk mitigation measures including risk transfer through insurance. The Project is considered as Paris Aligned based on the analysis of use of proceeds for mitigation (BB1), risk and materiality for adaptation (BB2) and VPBank’s very limited exposure to hard infrastructure assets. Considering the scope of targeted investments, the Project will follow transaction-based approach with each of the underlying investments being screened for Paris alignment by the VPBank and confirmed by the Bank in cases where sub-projects are not on the Paris aligned list for mitigation, or in cases of high or medium exposure to physical climate risks. Where and if needed, VPBank will conduct an additional screening assessment upon guidance from the Bank to confirm Paris alignment on BB1 (mitigation) and BB2 (adaptation).Stakeholder Engagement, Information Disclosure and Monitoring Arrangement.VPBank discloses a summary of its ES commitments and ESMS on its website both inEnglishandVietnameselanguages. Where applicable and in line with national regulations, VPBank will require that all sub-borrowers disclose ES information and conduct stakeholder engagement activities during the sub-loan tenure. VPBank shall also include such requirements as covenants and disbursement conditions in sub-loan agreements. VPBank will be required to publish retrospectively and to report to AIIB an annual summary of the ES aspects and overview of the project’s ES performance. During project implementation, AIIB will require submissions of relevant ES documentation and ES monitoring reports from VPBank in an agreed format, providing update on the implementation of the enhanced ESMS and a summary of the ES performance of each sub-project. AIIB will conduct post-reviews of the selection and implementation of sub-projects as part of its regular supervision, comprising of engagement with VPBank, potential site visits and detailed review of the ES documentation of selected sub-projects.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).VPBank has a fully functionalExternal Communication Mechanism (ECM)for their general operations, including for the proposed Project as project GRM, to address third-party views, enquiries or concerns regarding their own ES processes and outcomes. During the ESDD for the first loan to VPBank, the current ECM was reviewed and found to be accessible and satisfactory. VPBank will require sub-borrowers undertaking Category A and high-risk Category B to establish or maintain the GRM at sub-project level that are commensurate with the ES risks of the sub-projects. Lower-risk investments (Category C or lower risk Category B) undertaken by MSMEs and/or individuals under retail on-lending modality will rely on VPBank’s GRM and as a second tier on the national system, which encompasses grievances from customers or anyone reporting social and environmental violations. VPBank’s ESDD process will check whether eligible sub-borrowers have a mechanism, procedure, or process to receive and resolve grievances of Project-affected People. The GRM for lower-risk (as specified above) sub-projects may utilize existing formal or informal mechanisms, provided they are functioning and fit for purpose of the sub-borrower’s operations. The information of the GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be disclosed timely in an appropriate manner.",,FI,OK

The Program is placed in Category FI, as the financing structure involves the provision of funds to the VC funds pursuant to which AIIB delegates the decision-making related to the use of the AIIB's funds for investee companies that meet the conditions of the investment guidelines to be agreed with the VC Funds. For each VC fund, the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) which details the selection, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of investee companies, will be enhanced to be aligned with AIIB's ESP. An overview of enhanced ESMS for each VC fund will be prepared and disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner.The Program portfolio will comprise mainly early-stage green and technology-enabled investee companies which may be classified as Category B or C. Each investee company will be screened to identify the risks and following the due diligence, appropriate mitigation measures will be adopted. Activities included in AIIB's ESEL, Category A and any investee companies that may trigger ESS 2 land acquisition and involuntary resettlement and ESS 3 indigenous peoples will not be eligible for financing. Coal mining, coal transportation, and coal-fired power plants, as well as infrastructure services exclusively dedicated to supporting any of these activities, are also excluded.For all Higher Risk Activities proposed for Bank financing, the Bank requires each VC Fund to furnish its detailed environmental and social due diligence for the Bank's prior review and approval. Regarding renewable investments, the VC Fund will review potential supply chain related labour and working conditions, require appropriate mitigating measures, and seek AIIB's advice if required. As an LP to VC funds, AIIB may exercise excuse rights on any investee company which does not meet our E&S requirements or internal policies.Each VC Fund will be required to disclose the name, industry, and location of investee companies supported with AIIB's proceeds on its corporate website within twelve months of closing an investment. For all Higher Risk investments, each VC fund will be required to disclose annual E&S documentation during the preceding 12 months, unless such disclosure is subject to the host country's regulatory requirements, market sensitivities or consent of the investee company.AIIB will conduct post-reviews of the selection and implementation of investments as part of its regular supervision, comprising engagement with the VC Fund, potential site visits once conditions allow and a detailed review of the E&S documentation of selected investments.Each VC Fund will establish an External Communication Mechanism (ECM) as a project-level grievance redress mechanism (GRM) to address third-party views, inquiries, or concerns regarding their E&S processes and outcomes, as well as E&S impacts and performances of their investee companies. In addition, the Bank will require each VC Fund, for investee companies financed by AIIB proceeds, to disclose at an appropriate time the required ES information at the investee level, as well as investee-level GRM. The GRMs will be accessible, include provisions for anonymity, and hold no risk of retaliation, to receive and facilitate the resolution of the concerns and complaints of people who believe they may be or have been adversely impacted by the Program.

In addition, AIIB Environmental and Social Standard 1 (ESS 1) “Environmental and Social Assessment and Management” applies in full, and the applicability of ESS 2 “Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement” will be assessed during Project preparation. Indigenous people are not affected by the Project and therefore ESS 3 “Indigenous Peoples” is not triggered. Based on the available information, the Project has been preliminarily categorized as B, as environmental and social (ES) impacts and risks are predicted to be minor, localized, reversible and temporary. There is not expected to be any involuntary resettlement, and no areas or species designated for their importance to biodiversity are expected to be affected. Risks and impacts associated with this type of infrastructure development are standard and can be effectively managed when practical and well-established mitigation measures are in place.Environmental and Social Instruments:The Project ES instruments will include an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that complies with Bahrain's national legislation, encompassing an environmental baseline and a construction-phase assessment. Additionally, a supplementary Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will be conducted to address any gaps between the national EMP and AIIB’s ESP and ESS’s. A comprehensive Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) will be developed to consolidate all requirements and mitigations measures identified in both the national EMP and the supplementary ESIA. An ES audit will also be carried out on works completed prior to the start of the Bank funded project, including utilities relocation. In addition, due diligence to determine if any additional associated facilities exist will be carried out prior to the Appraisal of the Project.Environmental Aspects:The Project is part of the East Hidd Development Access Roads and Junctions Upgrade Program but will be built independently. A framework Construction Environmental Management Plan (fCEMP) was prepared in 2021 for the whole Program, including the Project, covering environmental baseline, impact assessment, and mitigation for construction-phase risks such as air quality, noise and vibration, geology and groundwater, waste management, terrestrial ecology, traffic and transport, occupational health and safety, and landscape and visual changes. The fCEMP identified ecologically designated areas and confirmed that none will be affected by the Project. Similarly, although a baseline ecology survey has not been completed the fCEMP concluded that the sterile lands that will be taken have negligible ecological value. In addition, the road widening will result in the removal of palm trees (planted in rows along the roadside), and all trees lost will be replaced, following a national requirement.Social Aspects:The Project activities are not expected to result in involuntary resettlement as it is a rehabilitation of an already available right of way (ROW). To ensure alignment with AIIB’s ESF, gaps in the national ES assessment standards, as outlined in the fCEMP, will be assessed and addressed during Project preparation. The fCEMP does not cover design and O&M phase risks and impacts for all ES topics and lacks AIIB's social requirements in its construction phase assessment. Therefore, the Ministry of Works (MOW) will engage an experienced ES consultant familiar with MDB standards, including those of AIIB, to (i) perform a gap analysis of the Project against AIIB’s ESF; and (ii) develop a gap closure plan and implement the necessary actions to ensure conformance with AIIB’s ESF.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure:Meaningful and inclusive stakeholder engagements will be conducted during the preparation of the ESIA. This will be further strengthened in phases during the finalization of the ESIA and related ES instruments. The draft English versions of the ESIA and related ES instruments, and English, Arabic versions of the Executive Summaries will be prepared and posted on the MOW’s and AIIB’s websites and made available in hard copies in the project area.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM):A multi-tier GRM will be developed according to the Bank’s ESP requirements. Locally appropriate public consultation and disclosure processes will be used to disseminate information about the GRM. In addition, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for worker’s grievances. The information of established GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring Arrangement:The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will have primary responsibility for monitoring the Project's progress and performance. Regular monitoring reports will be prepared using an agreed-upon format and submitted to the Bank through periodic reports. AIIB will also conduct supervision and monitoring missions at the project site.

ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) apply to this project, while ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable.Categorization and Instruments.The project has been classified as category A, in accordance with the ESF and ESP, because of anticipated environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts due to project locations. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and the Resettlement Plan (RP) have been prepared. In addition, a Labor Management Procedures (LMP), a Stakeholders Engagement Plan (SEP), and a Gender-based Violence (GBV) prevention plan is prepared as part of ESIA.Environmental Aspect.The ESIA has identified the potential environmental risks and impacts of the project’s construction phase, including soil erosion; dust emissions caused by the operation of machinery and running vehicles on earthen tracks along the access routes; gaseous emissions from construction vehicles, machinery, and generators; release of waste effluents and solid wastes from construction areas and camps causing soil and water contamination; loss of natural vegetation and trees in the right of way; and occupational health and safety (OHS) hazards for the construction staff and other project site personnel. During the ESIA, all possible measures were undertaken by PGCB to avoid any impacts on the biodiversity along the right of way. Accordingly, the project route from Anwara substation to Cox’s Bazar (North) substation was realigned from the Concept stage to avoid part of the proposed overhead transmission line passing through Chunati wildlife sanctuary. The Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) delineates mitigation measures for these identified ES risks and impacts, and as part of ESMP, the contractor will develop a biodiversity management plan (BMP) during the implementation phase before starting the relevant part of transmission line construction. The ESMP includes the reporting mechanisms for the responsible agencies and the monitoring plans during the implementation phase.Social and Gender Aspect.The project requires approximately 73 acres of land – about 40 acres for four substations and about 33 acres for transmission tower footings. For the substation lands, 35 acres will be acquired from owners of private agricultural land, resulting in the permanent economic displacement of 233 households, and BHTC will provide the remaining 5 acres. For the transmission tower footing, compensation is required to be paid to 33 acres of landowners affected by the tower footprint. For this purpose, an RP has been prepared based on surveys, social assessments, and consultations with project-affected households. The entitlement matrix in the RP summarizes the main types of losses and the corresponding entitlements following the legal framework of GoB (Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Act of 2017) and AIIB’s ESS2. An RP implementing consultant will be engaged by PGCB during the implementation period. In addition to this, the influx of construction workers poses inherent risks related to gender dynamics, potentially giving rise to issues such as GBV, sex exploitation (SE) and sexual harassment (SH), therefore, it is imperative to implement a detailed GBV prevention plan by the Project that will serve as a guiding framework throughout project implementation.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.Public consultations have been carried out with project-affected households and key project stakeholders and will be continued during project implementation. A SEP has been prepared to provide for consultations with stakeholders during the entire project cycle, procedures for disclosing information about the project, mechanisms for addressing and responding to grievances, and reporting back to the stakeholders. The final ESIA and RP, along with executive summaries, in English are disclosed on the project implementing entity’s and AIIB’s website. Prior to the consideration of the financing, executive summaries of the ESIA and RP in Bengali language will also be disclosed by PGCB in an appropriate manner as well as on the bank website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be constituted for the project before the start of construction activities in line with the prescriptions of the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) Policy of the Bank, building on the existing complaint mechanisms of PGCB. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for project workers' grievances. The information of established GRMs and the Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) both in English and Bengali will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.The project’s ES issues, including ESMP implementation, will be monitored by PGCB with assistance from an external ES monitoring consultant. PGCB will prepare semi-annual ES monitoring reports per the agreed format and submit the reports to AIIB at regular intervals. Also, AIIB will supervise the project's ES aspects with support from local ES consultants and conduct onsite supervision missions regularly.",,Category A,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) apply to the Project; the latter in relation to the potential for livelihood impacts only. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable as there are no Indigenous Peoples identified in the Project area. The project is assigned Category B in accordance with the ESP on the basis that the project environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts will be localized and temporary and can be mitigated through effective E&S management.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been prepared based on requirements provided by the Bank and which includes an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). These E&S instruments set out the measures committed to ensure that the project’s E&S risks and impacts are managed in a manner consistent with AIIB’s ESP and ESSs. Compliance with the ESMP will be made a covenant of the loan agreement.Environmental Aspects.The main environmental risks and impacts of laying underground cables occur during the construction phase. Once cables are laid very limited maintenance is required except in the event of a fault developing. As the project is being implemented in a fully urban environment and cables were pre-laid in a few key risk areas as part of past projects, environmental risks are limited. Biodiversity is not considered a sensitivity as no works will be undertaken in areas designated for their biodiversity value or which may support sensitive habitats and / or species. Potential environmental risks and impacts identified and assessed in the ESIA for the construction phase of the project include i) bentonite breakthrough from HDD works, ii) surface water and groundwater pollution (primarily sediment run off but potentially from very small volumes of fuel and oils) from construction effluent and wastewater discharges; iii) temporary construction emissions to air, including dust and exhaust fumes; and iv) noise and vibration. The potential risks and impacts are standard for this type of project and management measures are well understood in the industry. Electric and magnetic fields (EMF) above the buried cable have been considered and based on proxy studies have been found to be substantively below International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) reference levels for safe public exposure. The ESIA is considered by the Bank to provide an appropriately robust assessment of the risks and relevant, typical mitigations are presented and committed in the ESMP. No location-specific sensitivities requiring further attention have been identified. Contractors will be required to comply with ESMP requirements.Social and Gender Aspects.Acquisition of land will not be necessary as the cables will be laid within the width of existing public roads. As maintenance is not required except in case of cable fault, impacts are not expected once the cable is buried. Potential adverse social impacts and risks are therefore limited to the construction phase, associated with road excavation, cable laying and burial / road resurfacing works. Potential impacts assessed in the ESIA included temporary livelihood impacts on roadside vendors, temporary access disruption to roadside dwellings, temporary disruption and delays to road traffic movements, temporary disruption of water and telecommunication, and temporary delays to waste collection. In particular, the potential to affect the livelihoods of the many households in particular women headed households and individuals engaged in informal economic activities (such as food suppliers and grocery outlets) along the project-affected roads was identified as a key risk. To avoid impacts on these vulnerable populations works will be carried out at night and access to business operations restored by morning. In the event of any construction over-run into the daytime, the client has committed to compensating affected parties. Social mitigation measures are captured in the project ESMP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Working Conditions and Supply Chain.Key occupational health and safety (OHS) risks to workers include working with electricity, working in excavations and working in proximity to road traffic amongst others. The ESMP identifies key OHS risks and requires the establishment and implementation of Contractor OHS plans in line with World Bank Group Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. It is also a contractual requirement for construction contractors to provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Safety risks to community members and third parties also exist and hazards include for example the risk of falling into excavations or being struck by project construction traffic. These hazards and risks are identified in the ESMP and standard industry mitigations committed. CEB will also ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws and regulations.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Public consultations were carried out with all target groups, including district officers, community leaders, local government, and household representatives during the preparation of the ESIA. Prior to undertaking any civil works, community awareness programs will be scheduled to be conducted jointly by the CEB and the Contractor to inform the scope of the project, procedure of construction activities, possible disturbances to utilities, anticipated impacts, and mitigation measures. Furthermore, printed material such as posters, leaflets containing the project details, its anticipated impacts, implementation procedures and time frames and grievance redress procedures etc. will be distributed among all parties who would be potentially affected by the project. Such information will also be posted in public places. The CEB will ensure that copies of the ESIA conducted for this project as well as the ESMP are made accessible to any stakeholders either in the form of hard copies or electronically in English, Sinhala and Tamil. The referenced documents will be posted on CEB’s and AIIB’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).In order to resolve any public complaints and/or grievance/s, a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be instituted and will remain active throughout the life cycle of the project. The GRM will be in three tiers. Firstly, any aggrieved parties can report their grievances and complaints directly to the civil contractor either verbally (in person, or via telephone) or in writing. Any issues not resolved at tier 1 will be escalated to the Project Management Unit (PMU) for consideration and resolution by representatives of the project director, the contractor and assigned civil society organization (CSO). When affected persons are not satisfied with tier 1 and 2 decisions access is afforded to the Divisional Secretariat (tier 3). A separate workers’ GRM is committed in the ESMP. The workers GRM will be defined and adopted by Project parties in accordance with the requirements of AIIB’s ESP to address workplace complaints and concerns. The information of established GRMs and AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements. The PMU Project Director, supported by E&S personnel, will be responsible for compliance monitoring and supervising the implementation of the ESMP. Compliance monitoring will be carried out against key performance indicators set out in the ESMP and findings will be reported semi-annually to AIIB based on agreed format. The Bank will also undertake its own compliance field monitoring missions as needed, to verify findings. The frequency of the missions will depend on implementation progress and complexity.",USD52 million,Category B,OK

EBRD has categorized ES risks of the Project as Category B (which is equivalent to Category B if the AIIB’s ESP were to be applied). The ES risks and impacts, as assessed, are limited, reversible, localized, and will mainly occur during the construction phase.Environmental and Social Instruments.An initial environmental assessment (IEE) for the Project was completed in November 2021 under the Environmental Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Lenders’ ES consultant has conducted the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD), reviewed the Project against the applicable ES performance standards (PS) of EBRD, and proposed an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP). Based on the ESDD findings and the agreed ESAP to address the identified ES risks and impacts, a Non-Technical Summary (NTS) and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) have been prepared and reviewed by Lenders.Environmental Aspects.Project construction will generate dust, noise, wastewater, solid waste and have occupational health and safety-related risks and impacts, which includes hazards associated with working at height, movement of heavy machinery and equipment, lifting operation, traffic safety, and exposure to hazardous material. The operational stage environmental impact includes air emissions from the boiler, healthcare waste, wastewater discharge, and occupational health and safety-related impacts. These impacts will be mitigated through the implementation of the ESAP. For certain type of wastewater, pre-treatment will be done within the hospital boundary including use of neutralization tanks before discharge into the municipal sewage network. Based on the agreed ESAP in the commitment register, TURAR, the industry operator (sub-institution of the MoH) responsible for administration of hospital during the operation phase, will identify and assign a licensed medical waste disposal company to implement the medical waste management plan. This plan will be prepared prior to operational phase, aligning with the EBRD PR requirements.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.Based on the AIIB Paris Alignment methodology, this Project is considered aligned with the mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement as the Project operation type is included in the joint Multilateral Development Banks universally aligned list. With respect to climate adaptation, detailed designs are prepared to mitigate the plausible wildfire and flood risks. A robust ES Management Plan is prepared as well to address the related risks. The commitment of the Project to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification will make the Project consistent with the national adaptation plans.  The Project is therefore considered aligned with the adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement.Gender Aspects.A Gender Action Plan (GAP) for the Project has been developed by the Project company. The GAP sets out actions to be taken by the Project company to ensure a safe environment and present equal opportunities to women at the workplace. It also covers the Gender-Based Violence and Harassment (GBVH) risks and mitigation plan, with required resources, investment needs and responsible parties, as well as an implementation timetable. The TURAR has committed to implement the GBVH procedure during the Project operation stage, include trainings to the relevant staff provided by a third-party gender expert.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.It was assessed during the ESDD that about 2,300 jobs will be created during construction and it has been proposed in the ESAP to establish an ES management system at the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor level. During the operation stage, the Project company will hire around 60 staff for building maintenance and repair services and information management services. The ESDD also identified potential relocation of existing 1,492 healthcare staff affected by the new hospital operation. Based on the commitment register, TURAR will prepare and implement a relocation plan that complies with the national labor law and the EBRD’s PR2 requirement.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure.A stakeholder engagement plan (SEP) has been prepared to effectively engage with stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of the Project.

For a harmonized approach to addressing the E&S risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), IFC’s PESS and EL are applicable to the Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed the IFC’s PESS and EL and is satisfied that: (a) they are consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including AIIB’s Environmental and Social Exclusion List; and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. The Project has been categorized as FI in accordance with IFC's PESS, and this is equivalent to Category FI, if AIIB’s ESP were applicable. Further, the Project complies with the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles and IFC’s Blue Finance Guidance.Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS).Supported by IFC, SeABank has already developed an ESMS, the implementation of which is guided by international good practices, including IFC’s PSs and IFC’s Environmental, Safety and Health (EHS) Guidelines as well as IFC’s sector-specific Guidelines. The ESMS has adequate provisions for the assessment of both new greenfield investment opportunities as well as refinancing of brownfield ones. The IFC’s E&S Action Plan (ESAP) agreed for implementation with SeABank encompasses provisions for (i) developing and incorporating an E&S screening procedure into the existing ESMS for the green and blue bonds in order to screen out transactions with high E&S risks contemplated by the IFC Performance Standards, and (ii) providing training on high-risk screening procedure for the staff involved in implementation of the procedure. The sub-projects for AIIB’s consideration will be screened (as per AIIB’s eligibility criteria) by SeABank’s investment team prior to SeABank’s E&S team involvement for assessing E&S risks of those sub-projects.Environmental and Social Aspects:E&S risks and impacts are related to small to mid-size energy efficiency and renewable energy projects based on the initial pipeline and agreed sectors. E&S risks associated with the construction and operation of these investments are related to air, water and noise pollution, health and safety during construction and operation, labour and working conditions, and waste management. Blue-labelled activities may trigger some biodiversity risks. The Bank will exclude Category A subprojects and Blue labelled activities related to fisheries, seafood, and aquaculture in order to limit the biodiversity risk exposure of the Project. Further, land acquisition, stakeholder engagement, information disclosure, and grievance redressal will be implemented as per SeABank’s ESMS. Any land procurement shall follow market practice and willing seller - willing buyer principle. Activities that result in any form of involuntary resettlement shall be excluded under the Project. Investments that might expose SeABank and bond investors to reputational risks or where SeABank assesses that E&S risks are not sufficiently mitigated will be excluded from the Bank’s consideration.Gender.The existing corporate policies adopted by the SeABank include provisions for equal opportunity, non-discrimination, and application of gender sensitive approach in both internal operations as well as underlying investments (through ESMS). SeABank implements gender-sensitive practices, which include induction training on gender inclusion for staff or contractors, training on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (POSH), unconscious bias and prevention from any form of discrimination, including gender identity, race, ethnicity or confession. SeABank monitors gender balance among its workforce, particularly at the mid-high management level, and strives for gender-balanced management representation. HR policies include gender-sensitive provisions for internal grievances. AIIB notes the adequacy of gender related policies, processes and broader awareness by the Issuer.Labour and Working Conditions.SeABank’s ESMS has dedicated policies such as Labour Regulation for own staff and dedicated guidelines for screening and assessing investments against Labour and Working Conditions (LWC) related requirements. The dedicated guidelines have been developed in compliance with the national labour code and IFC PS2. IFC is currently providing advisory support related to supply chain management and financing opportunities. The guidelines encompass provisions preventing investments in projects using any form of labour and working conditions. Those requirements are also applicable to contractors and direct suppliers of utility-scale Solar PV investments. Evidence and representations from direct suppliers are required to document compliance with the LWC requirements.Paris Agreement Alignment (PAA) and Climate Finance.The Project has a defined set of criteria for the use of proceeds and is determined to be Paris-aligned on mitigation objectives following a review of the expected use of proceeds. There is a low risk of misalignment based on compliance with the ICMA’s Green Bond Principles and IFC’s Blue Finance Guidelines. The Project is also considered aligned with the adaptation objectives of the Paris Agreement using a counterparty-based approach as the Issuer has a diversified portfolio with no one sector/sub-sector having significant climate risk exposure. Furthermore, the corporate ESMS includes considerations for assessing exposure and mitigating physical climate change risks.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure.SeABank discloses a summary of stakeholder engagements, including related communities, through annual reports and publishes on its website. Where applicable and in line with IFC PSs and national regulations, SeABank will require that all sub-projects disclose E&S information and conduct stakeholder engagement during the sub-loan tenure. SeABank will include such requirements as covenants and/or disbursement conditions in sub-loan agreements. In addition, a summary of the ESMS prepared for the Project will be disclosed by SeABank and AIIB within 6 months after subscription and upon updating the corporate ESMS with agreed provisions.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.SeABank will be required to maintain a comprehensive database comprising all relevant E&S information and report to AIIB a summary of the E&S aspects and an overview of the E&S performance of the Project’s portfolio annually. AIIB will have the right to conduct post-reviews of the selection and implementation of sub-projects as part of its regular supervision.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).SeABank has established an External Communication and Grievance Mechanism (the “ECM”) that includes a corporate GRM to receive and address environmental and social grievances related to both SeABank employees as well as from SeABank’s projects/customers. The ECM has been published on SeABank’s website. As per SeABank ESMS, sponsors of any higher-risk subprojects are required to develop and operationalize respective subproject level GRMs in line with the IFC’s PSs. Subprojects of lower E&S risks (such as Category C and Lower B) will rely on the corporate-level GRM (ECM) set up by SeABank. The Issuer’s ESDD process, defined in the ESMS, will check whether eligible sub-borrowers (excluding retail) have a mechanism, procedure, or process to receive and resolve grievances of Project-affected people. The grievance mechanism for lower-risk subprojects (excluding retail) may utilize existing formal or informal mechanisms if they are functioning and fit for the purpose of the sub-project’s operations. The information of those GRMs and the Project-affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM) of AIIB will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.",,FI,OK

The findings of these assessments will serve as basis for preparation of the ESIA, ESMP and RP to meet the Project requirements in accordance with AIIB’s ESP requirements.The environmental assessments, including identification of environmental impacts/risks and mitigation measures, will take into account the location of proposed activities and their environmental features, and focus on the following aspects: (i) eco-system in the project area (Area of Influence), especially components that will be impacted and modified due to project activities, such as drainage system in salt fields in Liaohe EDZ and shrimp ponds that constitute part of wetland in Yingkou FTZ; (ii) impact on habitat and their population; (iii) impact assessment focusing on construction and operational phases, by comparing various feasible alternatives (including the “without-project” scenario), and recommending any measures needed to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improvement of the environmental and social performance of the Project; (iv) stakeholder engagement, especially with Project Affected Peoples (PAPs) and information disclosure throughout project cycle; and (v) institutional arrangement and responsibility of ES management and monitoring during preparation and implementation. Environmental impacts during construction are expected to be mostly temporary and localized and will be mitigated through the implementation of prepared ESMP and the good practice. Key impacts during the construction phase will include generation of excavated waste, spoil and liquid waste; dust and noise emissions; disruption to vehicular traffic; and occupational health and safety risks for workers. The E&S documents will propose mitigation measures for construction as well as operational phases to minimize and reduce identified risks.Social.The Project related activities including land acquisition and civil works are likely to cause temporary and permanent physical and economic displacements of title- and non-titleholders. Moreover, there may be disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups including women, elderly, Person with Disabilities and those who are economically vulnerable. The plot of land required by the Liaohe EDZ for the Project currently belongs to the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the Yingkou Municipal Government, with above-ground structure used as salt fields. The Liaohe EDZ is in the process of acquiring the right to use the land from the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Based on the information available, limited or no economic displacement is anticipated, and an agreement is currently being negotiated with the salt field operators. Yingkou FTZ will also acquire land which includes shrimp ponds and is likely to require displacement of two existing enterprises.To mitigate the adverse impacts stemming from land acquisition and civil works of the Project, an additional E&S assessment covering the scope and the severity of impacts along with mitigation measures in the form of RP covering the project footprints of the Project sites will be carried out. The RP will include an Entitlement Matrix that identifies the entitled unit, compensation, and assistance measures. The compensation includes non-titleholders and special treatments to vulnerable groups identified by the Project. Long-term rehabilitation measures in the form of a Livelihood Restoration Strategy (LRS) are also included. The aim of the compensation, assistance and livelihood restoration measures are to improve or at least restore the livelihoods of all displaced people to pre-displacement levels.Gender.The ESIA will analyze the Project’s impacts on women and identified vulnerable groups and aim to explore avenues through which women’s participation can be enhanced. The Project will also seek to minimize the adverse effect of the potential risk of Gender-based Violence (GBV) by developing mitigation measures. The Gender Action Plan (GAP) that will be prepared as part of the RP for this Project will aim to cover GBV, gender inclusion, institutional capacity building, and gender-sensitive Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) related measures.Stakeholder Engagement and Monitoring.Stakeholder engagement through public consultation and communication and Focus Group Discussion will be carried out with various groups of stakeholders including project-affected people (PAPs), women and identified vulnerable groups as part of the preparation of E&S documents and continued throughout the project cycle. The stakeholder engagement aims to meaningfully and in a culturally appropriate manner engage with PAPs and local communities, disseminate information about the Project, impacts, grievance mechanism and mitigation measures and obtain feedback and suggestion on design related issues and mitigation measures. The concerns and aspirations of the communities and PAPs will be properly incorporated to strengthen the mitigation measures and design features of the Project. The ESIA will include a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), which will not only analyze the results of the sessions carried out so far but also outline future consultation and communication plan of the Project with various groups of stakeholders. The Project Management Office (PMO) will conduct site inspection and monitoring quarterly during project construction and the first year, and semi-annually thereafter and report to the Bank based on agreed format.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and the AIIB Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM).A project specific GRM in line with AIIB’s ESP will be established in the PMO to receive, acknowledge, evaluate and facilitate the resolution to the complaints relating to E&S issues with corrective actions proposed. In addition, PMO will be required to establish sub-PMO level GRM respectively as part of project specific GRM. A separate workers GRM will also be established to manage workplace complaints and concerns. These will be undertaken using understandable and transparent processes that are gender responsive, culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the affected people. Records of grievances received, corrective actions taken, and their outcomes shall be properly maintained. The information of established GRMs including PPM of the Bank in Chinese will be timely disclosed to the communities and PAPs in an appropriate manner.",USD200 million,Category A,OK

Intra-regional and local connectivity is essential for internal mobility and regional development. It grants most of the population, especially in the country’s remote areas, access to economic opportunities by unlocking vast industrial and agricultural potential. The regional road network in Uzbekistan was built in the 1950s and 60s and received little attention until recent years, resulting in inadequate maintenance and a growing road rehabilitation /reconstruction backlog. Special attention is given to Western Uzbekistan in the arid and environmentally vulnerable Aral Sea region.The proposed reconstruction works include climate resilient pavement reconstruction, bridge repair and construction, drainage enhancements, the installation of road safety measures, and the provision of bus stops. Where necessary, sidewalks will be added to enhance pedestrian safety. Crucially, road reconstruction will occur within the existing right-of-way, eliminating the necessity for land acquisition and resettlement. The feasibility study and preliminary design for the Project are currently in progress.The Project includes a dedicated component aimed at promoting social and economic inclusion, particularly for women and youth, in conjunction with the project interventions. This component encompasses targeted vocational training for women and climate change and road safety awareness programs for young people. Additionally, it supports the development of a digital geospatial platform to address implementation complexities and facilitate broader impact analysis. This is especially relevant as the local roads stated for reconstruction connect to various socioeconomic centers such as education and health facilities.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs), and Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), is applicable to the Project. Following environmental and social (E&S) due diligence for project preparation at the Concept stage, ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) has been triggered. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) may also apply in a limited manner as land acquisition and/or impacts on livelihood may incur. Application of ESS 2 will be further verified during subsequent assessments, information on site selection and preparation missions. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable as no indigenous peoples are identified in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm Region according to AIIB team’s desk review and field visit. The Project has been assigned Category “B” in accordance with AIIB’s ESP due to the limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social impacts which will be limited to the Project area and can be managed using conventional E&S risk management strategies. The impacts are expected to be minor, mainly temporary linked to construction activities.Environmental and Social Instruments.The Project will follow a framework approach as the implementation details and final locations of the activities are not yet identified in sufficient detail. Thus, in accordance with Bank’s ESP, E&S Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) will be developed covering the regions, which will include a generic Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF). The ESMPF will elaborate the regulatory frameworks under which the Project will be implemented, establish the baseline in the Project regions, identify potential Project activities, assess generic environmental and social risks and impacts of the activities, and define the screening process of activities. The ESMPF will provide guidance for the development of environmental and social documents for Project activities, i.e., Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Land Acquisition and Livelihood Restoration Plan (LALRP), ESMP and/or ES Code of Practice. The Borrower will ensure that the E&S instruments for Project activities are incorporated into the contractual agreement with the contractors and translated to site specific ESMP.Environmental and Social Aspects:The road rehabilitation will be limited to existing roads only and the existing width of the roads will be maintained. New road construction and road widening is not anticipated as part of this Project. Therefore, all road works will be carried out on previously disturbed land with minimal impact on the local flora and fauna of the region. The temporary negative impacts during construction of the road rehabilitation subprojects will be related to air pollution, noise, water pollution, disposal of wastes, traffic disruption, access restriction for the community, and disturbance to the community due to influx of workers. The negative impacts of the operation of the Project may include increased vehicle speed due to improved road condition which can cause serious accidents and loss of property and life. The ESMPF will assess the risks and suggest generic mitigation measures to be included in the detailed design and relevant construction contracts to minimize the environmental impacts. The magnitude of impact on land leading to income loss will be assessed during project preparation. Permanent and temporary impacts on land will also be assessed during subsequent social assessments. Detailed impacts on land and livelihood will be assessed during project implementation when the site-specific activities are defined, sites are selected, and site-specific assessments and data become available.Occupational Health and Safety, Gender, Labor and Employment Conditions:The generic ESMP in the ESMPF will include measures to address occupational health and safety (OHS) issues during both construction and operation phases of the Project, especially OHS risks associated with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the roads. The ESMPF will also assess the risks of influx of migrant labors and its impacts on the community. The potential risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and sexual exploitation will be assessed, and appropriate measures will be required to be incorporated in the contracts for Contractors. Furthermore, a Gender Action Plan (GAP) for the Project will be prepared to define relevant trainings for sustainable economic development and to address issues of ease and safe travel by women, which will also envisage a proactive role for women participating in planning, design, implementation and operation of the Project. In addition, the labor working conditions will also be analyzed and addressed in the ESMPF.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure:Stakeholder mapping and consultations will be conducted during the preparation of the ESMPF. The English version of the ESMPF and the executive summaries of the local language(s) will be disclosed by the client both online and made available in hard copy in the Project area. The ESMPF will also set out procedures and requirements on stakeholder engagement, public consultation and information disclosure for Project activities during the implementation of this Project. The documents will also be posted on the Bank’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) that accords with the requirements of the Bank’s ESP will be indicated in the ESMPF and established for the proposed Project prior to its implementation. The public consultation and disclosure process will be used to disseminate information about the multi-tier GRM. A separate project contracted workers’ GRM will also be developed for their concerns and the complaints. Also, AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) in local languages will also be disclosed timely to local communities and PAPs in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Reporting.The PIU will be responsible to monitor project progress and performance based on the result indicators. To ensure the efficient monitoring of E&S aspects in the challenging and remote areas of Khorezm and Karakalpakstan, PIU will employ dedicated E&S staff locally. These personnel will directly report to the E&S specialist and PIU head in Tashkent, ensuring seamless coordination and effective implementation throughout the Project duration. The Bank plans to conduct regular field visits per year to monitor progress and may conduct additional field visits as and when required during the initial years. Details of those arrangement will be determined and integrated into the final ESMPF.",USD200 million,Category B,OK

The Project has been placed in Category FI because the financing structure involves the provision of funds through a Financial Institution (FI), whereby AIIB delegates to JC Leasing the decision-making on the use of AIIB's funds towards subprojects meeting the conditions agreed upon with JC Leasing. This includes the selection, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of subprojects and the oversight of the sub-borrowers and subprojects in line with AIIB's ESP requirements. All Category A and higher risk Category B subprojects will be excluded as defined by AIIB’s ESP.Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS).JC Leasing does not yet have an ESMS nor designated E&S roles and responsibilities. As part of the Project, JC Leasing will be required, among others, to develop and implement an ESMS with the support of IFC Advisory Team to assess and manage the E&S risks consistent with the applicable E&S performance requirements in line with the IFC Performance Standards and designate an ESMS officer and provide E&S training for relevant staff. AIIB E&S Specialists will also support the client so that the ESMS can be consistent with AIIB’s ESP, to incorporate the ESEL and applicable provisions of the ESSs. The ESMS will integrate E&S risk management procedures appropriate to the level of risks and impacts associated with supported subprojects. The ESMS will also ensure that the selection, appraisal, approval and monitoring of subprojects is consistent with AIIB’s ESP requirements and AIIB's ESSs that will include the following: (a) a project-specific exclusion criteria list; (b) templates for E&S due diligence (ESDD) and assessment; (c) templates for implementation and supervision; (d) an EHS/OHS plan or procedure to serve as the baseline for monitoring incidents, accidents, near misses or fatalities in the Project; (e) a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP); (f) Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs) for both internal workers and affected communities.Environmental and Social Aspects.The Project supports JC Leasing’s expansion of sustainable finance offerings, including energy efficiency, clean transport, renewable energy, water supply and water sanitation. JC Leasing’s portfolio showcases a commitment to moderate-risk subprojects with relatively small ticket sizes and average tenures of 24 to 36 months. JC Leasing’s operations follow three business models: direct leasing, sale−leaseback, and operational lease. Most of its green and blue portfolio and pipeline relate to the leasing of energy-efficient manufacturing equipment and upgraded public utility infrastructure. The ESMS will include procedures with implementing tools or guidance to identify and exclude Higher Risk Activities from the activities supported by AIIB. In addition, tools and guidance such as ESDD checklists included in the ESMS will also ensure the client’s verification of sub-borrowers’ compliance with national and local environmental and social related laws and regulations, and AIIB’s ESF. An E&S Action Plan has been developed and agreed with JC Leasing, with specific actions and time-bound deliverables to help the client meet the E&S requirements of AIIB.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.In its 2022 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report, JC Leasing expresses its commitment to advance China’s national climate strategies including its NDC objectives of reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2060. The Project will enable JC Leasing to cover additional green and blue economy sectors as it focuses on the areas of energy efficiency, clean transport, renewable energy, water supply, and water sanitation. JC Leasing recognizes, through its ESG report, the importance of assessing the financial impacts of climate change risks. It identifies both transition and physical climate risks, as well as the associated financial impacts in terms of operating costs, incomes, and portfolio valuation. It also identifies climate change opportunities, including investment in adaptation. The Project will accelerate the mainstream of JC Leasing high-level climate risk mapping into leasing operations through an ESMS that incorporate climate risk assessment and management.Gender Aspects.The Project will aim to promote gender diversity and inclusion. The development of the ESMS will include gender specific opportunities to develop mitigation measures to avoid or reduce such risks and impacts, including, as appropriate, measures to identify and address the risks of gender-based violence (GBV) and risks of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH), as applicable, on the subprojects.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor, and Employment Conditions.An OHS plan or procedure, as part of the ESMS, will be prepared includes requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all subproject activities that pose a risk to employees and may also have the potential for disruption of site works.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.During the Project implementation, JC Leasing will be required to submit relevant E&S documents including updates on the implementation of the ESMS and updates on the E&S performance of the subprojects. JC Leasing will be required to disclose a summary of the E&S documentation including an overview of ESMS both in English and Chinese in a timely manner. AIIB will provide links with those E&S documents disclosed by JC Leasing. The requirement for proportionate stakeholder consultation will be assessed during the appraisal process.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.AIIB will further assess the existing Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) of JC Leasing for workers and stakeholders and include further enhancement into the ESMS if required. Under its ESMS, JC Leasing will require sub-borrowers to establish a suitable subproject-level GRM and inform people and communities in the Project’s footprint about its availability.

The E&S instrument will be the Asakabank Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS).Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS).Asakabank has a track record implementing other MDBs’ ES requirements on trade finance and SMEs. Asakabank is expanding its ES risk management practice to cover all banking business activities. The bank has recently approved an ESMS under the guidance of EBRD, which will roll out implementation with a series of capacity-building programs supported by an external consultant. Based on the approved ESMS shared with AIIB, Asakabank will: (i) screen the proposed loans against its E&S exclusion list, (ii) assign an E&S categorization, (iii) conduct E&S appraisal, (iv) include applicable ES Action Plans (ESAPs) and covenants in loan agreements, (v) monitor E&S risks and impacts, (vi) set up a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) for internal and external stakeholders, and (vii) report to lenders and investors. Subproject beneficiaries will be required to: (a) provide ES and sustainability-related information per the standard ES questionnaire, (b) implement ESAP as per the loan agreement, and (c) establish a GRM for workers and stakeholders.Environmental and Social Characteristics.Based on the review of the indicative pipeline and discussions with the client, AIIB proceeds will support energy efficiency equipment capex and potential small-scale renewable energy projects. All of the indicative energy efficiency loans and renewable projects have capex below USD4 million, with medium or low ES risk for supported activities. AII higher-risk subprojects will be excluded from the AIIB support portfolio.Labor and Working Conditions.The ESMS includes requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all Project activities that pose a risk to employees and site works. Although AIIB funding will only support energy efficiency and renewable energy equipment capex, Asakabank will assess the borrowers’ Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) performance.Climate Change and Paris Alignment.Based on the preliminary pipeline, the proposed renewable and energy efficiency subprojects are automatically considered Paris Aligned under BB1 (mitigation) as they deliver climate mitigation goals. Furthermore, the proceeds will be used for purchasing equipment and will be of small size, thus they are considered as having low physical climate risk exposure, being spread across multiple locations through a diversified set of clients. Therefore, all subprojects are considered Paris-aligned for BB2 (adaptation). The project team has discussed with Asakabank eligibility criteria for energy efficiency projects to meet EE improvement of more than 15%. Based on that, 100 percent of the preliminary pipeline will qualify as climate mitigation finance.Information Disclosure and Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Asakabank will be required to disclose an overview of its ESMS and ES policy per AIIB ESP requirements prior to signing. The ESMS will provide good guidance for sub-borrowers to establish their GRMs as subproject level GRMs. Asakabank is in the process of establishing its GRM for receiving and addressing grievances to enable all stakeholders to have the right access, which will be disclosed to the public before disbursement.

A Corporate Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) Audit has been conducted on the existing ESMS of Gulf Renewable Energy Company Limited (GED) to assess the corporate capacity of GED for ES management of the 12 sub-projects and strengthen the ESMS to meet ADB’s SPS. InitialEnvironmental Examination (IEE) and Social Compliance Audit (SCA)have been developed to assess the legacy issues and mitigation measures for the first five sub-projects. GED will screen, categorize and prepare the IEEs, SCAs and other required instruments for the remaining seven sub-projects as per ESMS. AIIB together with co-financers will review and confirm the screening and categorization results as well as the ES documents for these remaining subprojects.Environmental Aspects.No protected areas or reserved forests were identified within the Project boundary. For the first five sub-projects, solar farms will be developed on land previously used for agricultural activities. Based on the due diligence, those sub-projects including their transmission lines are located on modified habitat (agriculture, commercial, residential and public infrastructures such as roads and irrigation canals) and not located within critical habitat. Environmental impacts are expected to be short-term, localized and mitigated/minimized to an acceptable level with implementation of environmental management plans prepared as part of IEE reports.Social Aspects.The land use in the Project sites is identified as agricultural area, which were previously used as sugar cane, cassava, corn or rice fields. All the sites are close to urban areas, and the use of land or resources by Indigenous Peoples has not been observed. Transmission lines, not being financed through the lenders, utilize the lands along the right-of-way, which is legally granted by the Department of Highway, and is to be implemented by the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand (PEA) and/or its subsidiary. SCAs for the five sub-projects concluded that no non-compliance is present. The SCAs concluded that Project’s impacts on livelihoods are not anticipated. The Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will address any potential grievances on project land use and livelihoods. Implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMP) and Procedures prepared as part of the IEEs and corporate ESMS to be updated and adopted prior to financing will address the ES risks and impacts in compliance with lenders’ requirements.Gender Aspects.The Project contributes to gender equality in Thailand and the region by supporting GED to continue its demonstration effect. GED has established a clear policy and framework for diversity and related processes. GED is assessed as a strong performer on gender equality. The proportion of women working at GED by job level compares favorably to benchmark mid-market companies in Thailand and also compares favorably to global energy sector averages. Labor influx during construction may exacerbate risks related to gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and sexual harassment. The ESMP includes measures to address the gender and social inclusion aspects of the Project.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions. The IEEs include detailed assessment of occupational health and safety aspects of the Project during construction and operation stages. IEE also includes ESMP with measures to mitigate potential health, safety, ES hazards in all the Project activities that pose a risk to employees and site workers. GED complies with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB’s Social Protection Strategy (2001), takes measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards. In addition, GED’s Supplier Code of Conduct requires all suppliers and contractors to implement appropriate management measures in respect of labor and working conditions in their supply chain operations.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Public consultations were held during the preparation stages of permitting report as per national laws and regulations. The consultations were held in May and June 2023 with communities within three-kilometer radius, provincial officers and other stakeholders. Information about the Project was disseminated in Thai. To carry out ongoing consultations, Stakeholder Engagement Plans are prepared. The ES documentation in English and relevant summaries in Thai are disclosed timely in an appropriate manner.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism. The grievance management will cover both internal and external grievances, site-specific grievance management procedures to receive, evaluate and facilitate the resolution of affected people’s and workers’ concerns, complaints and grievances related to social performance of the Project, more specifically related to compensations, privileges and livelihood support activities as applicable. The GRM aims to provide a time-bound and transparent mechanism to voice and resolve concerns linked to the Project. The GRM procedures will be implemented at site level as part of ESMP implementation, depicting the process involved in addressing the grievances along with contact details including the information of AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) both in English and Thai, so that workers and community members can access and register complaints.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements. The updated ESMS monitoring and reporting procedure will include procedures for ES aspects, parameters, reference standards and monitoring frequencies. A reporting template will be agreed between GED and lenders within three months of the first disbursement as per ESAP. Report to the lenders is required on a semi-annual basis during construction and on an annual basis thereafter. AIIB together with the lender group will review the implementation of ESMS through regular compliance monitoring.

The potential adverse ES impacts associated with the activities considered for financing are limited, not unprecedented or irreversible, localized to the Project’s site, and can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting.ES Instruments.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been prepared including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). An Environmental and Social Compliance Audit (ESCA) was commissioned by the ADB, and a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) was prepared with corrective measures, intended to close the gaps within a reasonable period of time. Through implementation of corrective measures, the project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with ADB SPS objectives.Environmental and Social Management System.The key ES issue for this project relates to the management and monitoring systems to assess and manage ES risks and impacts during construction, operation, and decommissioning in compliance with the applicable local regulatory requirements, ADB SPS, and good international industry practices (GIIP); assurance of fair, safe and healthy working conditions for employees and contracted workers in line with the legal and ADB SPS requirements and consistent management of occupational health and safety (OHS) policies and practices; monitoring and management of air emissions, waste and wastewater and hazardous materials; emergency preparedness and response including that for community engagement activities related to ES commensurate to the risks and impacts associated with the project. As part of the CAP, a full-scale ESMS shall be developed in alignment with ADB SPS requirements and to be implemented at site and corporate level.Environmental Risks and Impacts.The Project is expected to have impacts and risks associated with pre-construction and construction activities which include, but not limited to, generation of dust, increase in noise levels, soil erosion, impacts to water resources, potential accidental injury and/or mortality of at-risk species, loss/degradation of modified habitat (arable land) and moderately degraded natural habitat (savanna), hazardous materials, waste generation, labor and working conditions, health and safety, and increased traffic. And during operations, impacts and risks will primarily be related to water use, solid and hazardous waste, labor and working conditions, and health and safety. The ESMP was developed to mitigate these risks and impacts and a CAP in place to facilitate the project's adherence to ADB's safeguard requirements.Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement.The Project footprint is about 1650 acres along with the transmission line roughly 60 m in length as an Associated Facility. An environmental and social compliance audit (ESCA) as per ADB SPS was commissioned in November 2023 to review the compliance of ongoing preconstruction activities and land procurement process along with related involuntary resettlement. Per the ESCA, Enren is still in the process of acquiring the land for the project. Approximately 992 acres are private agricultural land being acquired through a long-term lease agreement on a willing lessor and willing lessee basis. A project Resettlement and Livelihood Restoration Plan (RLRP) will be prepared to address involuntary resettlement impacts on the affected people on such government land parcels and will be actioned if these parcels are finally allotted to the project. The RLRP will also address any impacts on landowners (landlessness, impoverishment) who willingly leased their land to the project through negotiated settlement.Gender Aspect and Labor and Working Conditions.Women’s safety at workplace is covered by the “Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013” and under the Women & Child Development Department at Government of Gujarat. Women’s employment in Borrower’s business activities is encouraged, including the Project’s operating and maintenance activities. In addition, the ESMP includes requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all Project activities that pose a risk to employees and may also have the potential for disruption of site works. All suppliers and contractors will be advised of the importance of implementing appropriate management measures to identify and address issues related to the environmental and social provisions of the ESMP, including labor and working conditions and health and safety matters. Compliance with the ESMP is an essential part of the contract document with suppliers and contractors. This compliance as well as representations and warranties to be provided to the Borrower by suppliers and contractors will be reflected in relevant agreements and contracts.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.As part of the project's CAP, a project-level stakeholder engagement plan (SEP) and grievance redress mechanism (GRM) will be developed. The Borrower and the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor will implement these project-specific SEP and GRM on site. Stakeholder engagement and consultations with project-affected people will also be done in relation to the implementation of the RLRP. The E&S documentation, including ESIA and ESMP, will be disclosed timely in English language and the Executive Summary or equivalent in local language(s) by Sponsor both online and made available in hard copy in the Project area.

ESS1 – Environmental and Social Assessment and Management, ESS2 – Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement, and ESS3 – Indigenous Peoples are considered applicable.Environmental and Social Categorization and Instrument.As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project is currently proposed as Category A, considering significant land acquisition required for new construction. Based on the current environmental and social (ES) impacts screening results, the Project Implementation Agency (PIA) will prepare an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) with an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP); a due diligence on completed land acquisition and resettlement activities, and a Resettlement Plan (RP) for newly added resettlement activities by the Project in compliance with ESS2 requirements; and an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) or Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP) which needs to be confirmed by the results of the social impacts assessment. The required ES instruments will be further assessed during Project preparation.Environmental Aspects.The Project’s adverse environmental impacts are mainly during the construction phase, including dust and air emissions; soil erosion; surface water, groundwater and soil pollution; noise and vibration; hazardous materials/chemicals; disposal of spoil soil, solid wastes and dredged sludge; vegetation clearance for the Right of Way (RoW); disturbance to habitat and species; impacts on river’s hydrological characteristics from construction, etc. Based on an initial screening, the majority of Project activities is located in urban or suburban areas substantially modified by human activities, and therefore unlikely to cause significant adverse impacts to natural habitat or biodiversity. The proposed road from Liuzhi to Huangguoshu, however, will be in the vicinity of a national forest park (Huangguoshu Pubuyuan). Potential impact on the flora and fauna of the park will be assessed and to inform the route selection. If needed, a Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) will be prepared for impact mitigation. Operation phase related environmental impacts will mainly include air emissions and noise from vehicles, road safety, sludge and effluent from wastewater treatment plant, waste electric vehicle (EV) batteries recycling or disposal, and waste from agricultural processing. The raw water quality and safety of the existing dam for the water supply subproject will be analyzed during Project preparation.Social Aspects.The Project is expected to generate largely positive social benefits to the overall population. The preparation of subprojects will involve substantial community interface and potential risks and impacts. Social risks and impacts may include loss of livelihood or from physical or economic displacement due to permanent or temporary land acquisition, impacts on ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups, community health and safety risks, occupational health and safety risks of project workers and risks of land use right transfer, among others. Especially, the Project is expected to involve significant land acquisition and resettlement impacts due to new construction of road networks, like Liuzhi to Huangguoshu Road. The PIA will prepare and endorse a RP that complies with ESS2 and applicable laws and regulations of China. In addition, the Project, especially for the sub-component of Key Infrastructure in City Transport Network, will involve several rural communities where ethnic minorities are concentrated. Therefore, an IPP or EMDP may also need to be prepared in a culturally appropriate manner to avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts.Gender Aspects.As far as possible, all the collected data and analysis must be gender disaggregated to identify the specific practices, needs, and issues of women. Based on the results, the PIA should prepare a Gender Action Plan (GAP) and integrate women’s opinions and concerns into project design and implementation in order to promote the reduction of gender inequalities in the Project.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Labor and Working Conditions.The preparation of the ESMP will include requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all project activities that pose a risk to employees and may also have the potential for disruption of site works. In addition, all suppliers and contractors will be advised of the importance of implementing appropriate management measures to identify and address issues related to the ES provisions of the ESMP, including labor and working conditions and health and safety matters. As the potential investments of the Project include renewable energy, the PIA will be required all suppliers and contractors to implement appropriate management measures in respect of labor and working conditions in their supply chain operations will be part of ESMP. Compliance with the ESMP is an essential part of the contract document with suppliers and contractors. This compliance as well as representations and warranties to be provided to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) by suppliers and contractors will be reflected in relevant agreements and contracts.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) will be prepared by the PIA to assess the impacts to and influence by these various stakeholders, formulate differentiated approaches and strategies for engaging with them in a meaningful and culturally appropriate way, and specify the roles and responsibilities of project management and implementation units, designer, and contractors in implementing the SEP throughout the whole process of project preparation and implementation. The ES instruments including ESIA, ESMP and RP in English and Chinese, will be timely disclosed by the Borrower and the Bank on its website respectively at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to consideration of the Bank’s financing for approval if the Project is confirmed to be Category A.Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be established at the Project and subproject level to receive and facilitate resolution of the concerns or complaints of the people who believe they have been adversely affected by ES impacts of the Project. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, a commensurate mechanism will be made available for raising workplace related grievances. The information of established GRMs and the Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disseminated to local communities in an appropriate manner. GRMs will be operational before any Project activities.Monitoring and Reporting Arrangement.The PIU will be directly responsible for the overall coordination of project monitoring and reporting. A third-party agency will be hired to perform regular monitoring and reporting work based on an agreed-upon format. The Bank will carry out field-based ES supervision during implementation. During project preparation, a detailed monitoring and reporting arrangement with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and templates for periodic and annual progress reports will be developed and determined.",USD400 million,Category A,OK

Provision of at least 50,000 solar home systems (SHS), 80,000 household clean cooking technologies and 60 institutional clean cooking solutions.The Project will be jointly co-financed with the World Bank (WB) as the lead cofinancer.","Environmental and Social Policy.The loan will be co-financed with the WB as lead co-financier, and the Project’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the WB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF). To provide for a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the WB’s ESF will apply to the Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed the WB’s ESF and is satisfied that: (i) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and the relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs); and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project.Environmental and Social Instruments.To mitigate ES risks and impacts, in compliance with WB’s ESF, the Client has prepared appropriate ES instruments: theEnvironment and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP),Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF),Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF),Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP),Labor Management Procedures (LMP). The ESMF will provide for an exclusion list to exclude high-risk activities, particularly interventions in protected areas and critical habitats, and will incorporate Biodiversity Management Plans if significant impacts are anticipated. Site-specific ES risk management instruments required for the respective subproject activities will be ready before launching of the related contractor bidding process. For the sub-components being implemented by Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD), ES risks and impacts will be managed through BRD’s existing Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). AIIB and WB will review the ESMS to assess its adequacy, and any necessary changes will be completed prior to implementation of these activities.Environmental Aspects.The potential environment risks and impacts related to the Project during the construction and operation/maintenance phases are diverse and are expected to have both positive and negative impacts on the environment, as well as potential occupational health and safety (OHS) risks to workers and communities if not managed properly. The proposed activities under the Project, including civil works related to MV and LV power transmission and distribution lines, may have potential risks and impacts on biodiversity, natural resources, and/or cultural heritage sites. The planned activities could also pose environmental and OHS risks during replacement of transformers in the existing substations and construction of new ones and associated feeder connections. The Project’s technical assistance involving improvements in sector performance and policy/regulations may also entail direct and indirect ES risks. Furthermore, there are potential ES risks related to off grid solutions, which include electronic waste management issues comprising storage and final disposal of used batteries containing hazardous waste, recycling/disposal of solar panels from stand-alone SHS and related OHS issues such as fire and explosion risks from clean cooking solutions. The Project will not finance any activities that could adversely affect biodiversity conservation or the sustainable management of living resources.Social Aspect.The Project will have both positive and negative social impacts on people and communities in implementation areas. There will be no significant land conversion as a result of the Project, the key social risks and potential adverse impacts are related to project activities to scale up grid electricity access and clean cooking solutions in schools. These may include impacts on people’s livelihoods due to restrictions on land use and land acquisition, gender-based violence (GBV) brought about by labor influx at electricity construction sites and in schools where clean cooking infrastructures will be installed, and risks related to discrimination in accessibility of project services including solar systems. Social risks and impacts are expected to be site specific, predictable, and temporary, which may be prevented, managed and/or mitigated through the application of established mitigation measures, as detailed in the Project’s ES instruments.Gender.The Project will build on the efforts made under ongoing projects and help to address gender equality gaps, specifically by strengthening women’s access to new and improved energy, namely grid and off-grid electricity, clean cooking solutions and productive use of energy technologies, and by creating energy sector jobs for females in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Progress towards closing these gender gaps in Rwanda’s energy sector will be monitored through indicators in the results monitoring framework.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.Per the SEP, an operational grievance redress mechanism (GRM) at the level of the implementing agencies and at subproject level will be established prior to commencement of Project activities and will be operationalized and maintained throughout Project implementation. The GRM will be accessible to stakeholders at both Project and sub-project level and the information of established GRM and the Independent Accountability Mechanism (IAM) of World Bank will be disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner. In addition, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for workers’ grievances.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The implementing entities will prepare and submit quarterly monitoring reports on the Project’s ES performance throughout the Project implementation period.

The details and locations of the specific activities are not yet identified; therefore, a framework approach will be adopted by the Project.ES Categorization and Rationale.The Project is being proposed to be Category B, considering it will finance wastewater treatment plants in decentralized locations, associated facilities, and the operation of sanitation systems. During the appraisal, the Project’s Categorization will be further reviewed and finalized following the feasibility studies; Environmental and Social (E&S) assessments, and site visits.E&S Scoping and Planned Instruments.The draft Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) that includes the Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared. These instruments will be updated during project preparation and implementation to include E&S instruments, such as Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and generic Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), Resettlement Plan (RP), according to national laws and policies, and the Bank’s ESP and ESSs. Potential infrastructure and civil works under the Project could have significant impacts on both the environment and the community.Environmental Risks and Impacts. The construction and implementation of sanitation infrastructure will significantly improve living conditions, improved health, and sanitation, which will have significant effects on the health of the population and environment of those municipalities. At the same time the proposed Project activities will generate various adverse social impacts associated with land acquisition, resettlement, economic displacement, impacts on cultural heritage, disturbance to community and traffic, the influx of labor, health hazards, and labor safety issues due to facility siting, civil works and O&M. Vulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, women, the elderly, individuals with disability, those below the poverty line, and in informal sectors such as manual latrine cleaners can be disproportionately affected. In addition, the formalization of the septic tank desludging services will economically displace individuals or small enterprises that provide informal manual latrine cleaning services. A survey of such project-affected people or groups will be conducted as a part of the baseline social surveys of the Project.Climate Change.The Global Climate Risk Index rates Bangladesh as the seventh most affected country in the world from extreme weather events. The flash floods of 2022 affected 49,885 sanitation facilities. To reduce the negative impacts of extreme weather events, improved sanitation systems will be planned and implemented to be climate-smart and disaster-resilient. The ESMPF and Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will help to ensure this by incorporating appropriate adaptive measures into the project planning and providing guidelines for the design, construction, and operation of sanitation infrastructure that is climate-smart and disaster-resilient.Gender Aspects.Women and men often have different roles in sanitation activities and their needs, preferences, and challenges regarding sanitation services also vary across the groups. It is important to recognize the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by women and men, as well as other gender minorities. To recognize and address the issues, a Project-specific gender and social inclusion action plan will be developed to enhance the mainstreaming of vulnerable groups. The action plan is expected to include clear targets, gender-disaggregated data, vulnerable group design features, and measurable performance indicators to promote participation and benefits. Moreover, a gender-based violence prevention plan will also be prepared to manage the heightened risk of exploitation stemming from labor influx.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultations, and Information Disclosure.Along with outlining the disclosure strategy of the Project, the SEP, as encapsulated in the draft ESMPF, will highlight how consultation and communication will be conducted throughout the Project cycle. The SEP will identify all categories of stakeholders and will inform the design of the mitigation measures and E&S assessments. In addition, the PMU shall be responsible for the overall results monitoring and reporting for the Project. Detailed monitoring and reporting arrangements with clearly defined roles and responsibilities as well as the templates for periodic and annual progress reports will be developed and included in the PIM. The ESMPF and RPF will be disclosed on the government’s designated website and AIIB website once they are finalized but not later than the required time bound on its E&S categorization. The executive summaries of the E&S documents will be translated into Bengali and published online.Project-Level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and ES Monitoring.A Project-specific and gender-sensitive Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be established to receive, acknowledge, evaluate, and facilitate the resolution of the complaints relating to E&S issues with corrective actions proposed. This will be undertaken using understandable and transparent processes that are gender-responsive, culturally appropriate, and readily accessible to all segments of the affected people, including workers during project construction.",USD200 million,Category B,OK

The project is categorized FI, as the financing structure involving a fund, Actis, where AIIB delegates the Fund Manager for decision-making on the use of the Bank funds. This will include the selection, categorization, appraisal, approval, and monitoring of subprojects in accordance with AIIB’s ESP requirements. The environmental and social (E&S) instrument will be the Actis ESMS, enhanced as required to be consistent with AIIB’s ESP.Actis has an ESG policy which the Fund Manager will upgrade to align with AIIB ESP. The Actis approach aligns with, but not limited to, the UN- supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the IFC Operating Principles for Impact Management and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As is common practice with a robust E&S Management System (ESMS), the Actis ESMS will include an enhanced ESG Policy designed to (i) screen sub-projects against an exclusion list, (ii) assign an E&S risk categorization, (iii) conduct E&S due diligence with an action plan, (iv) monitor E&S risks and impacts of the sub-projects and (v) report to its management accordingly. The ESG Policy is considered to already be broadly aligned with AIIB’s ESP requirement. The Policy will be disclosed together with the ESMS, providing an overview of any changes made to further align with the AIIB ESP requirement, both by the Fund and the Bank in an appropriate manner.Actis targets to invest in (i) renewable energy infrastructure, (ii) energy solutions and (iii) sustainable transportation. Depending on the nature of the asset, unmitigated typical impacts could include, but not limited to, generation of solid waste, wastewater, noise, and disturbance to nearby residents, water quality impacts, ecological impacts, and local physical cultural resources. Category A subprojects are unlikely to be encountered and where they are, likely to be excluded subject to extensive due diligence. They are mostly site-specific, few if any of them are irreversible, and in most cases mitigation measures can be designed and implemented. Further to that, the ESMS details robust labor and working condition requirements which should be monitored closely by the Actis E&S team and reported to AIIB as required. As an LP, the Bank has excuse rights to be excused from a particular sub-project if the subproject does not meet E&S requirements of the Bank.Actis has established a two-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) system, at fund level and at asset level. At fund level, the GRM is publicized on the Actis website where it is named as “Complaints Redress Mechanism” (CRM). At the asset level, the Actis ESMS has provisions for complaints / grievances and the Fund Manager will monitor the performance and applicability of these GRM’s. Further, as part of the Fund’s E&S Due Diligence process, a robust review of the assets GRM at project level will be undertaken. The information of established GRM (CRM) and the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of the Bank will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.During project implementation, AIIB will require the submission of a project appraisal form, relevant E&S documentation, and annual E&S monitoring reports from the Fund in an agreed format providing an update on the implementation of the enhanced ESMS, and a summary of the E&S performance of each subproject.

The initial Environmental and Social (E&S) due diligence determined that ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) applies to the assessment of E&S impacts of Project activities. ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) also applies as Project-related activities can lead to adverse direct and indirect impacts on waste pickers and those who derive income from landfills and those located along the access road alignment that will be upgraded. The extent of physical displacement for upgrading access roads to the disposal facilities is anticipated to be limited as construction activities will be within the existing Right of Way (RoW). ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not apply to this Project. As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been assigned Category A, and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) and Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) have been prepared. The ESMPF and RPF will guide the preparation of subproject specific Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and site specific Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) including site specific Resettlement and Livelihood Restoration Plan (RLRPs) for all subprojects. Currently, four ULBs prepared a draft site specific ESIAs, Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), and Resettlement and Livelihood Restoration Plan (RLRPs).It is estimated that at least 4.31 million residents of the participating ULBs will benefit from the project, through increased access to improved SWM services and environmental, social and health conditions and improved working conditions of sanitation workers and better livelihood opportunities in waste management sector.Environment:The Project will reduce exposure to pollutants and disease vectors associated with solid waste through enhanced SWM services thereby improving environmental and public health conditions. The Project will construct SWM infrastructure covering waste collection, transportation, processing and disposal facilities, and dumpsite remediation. The potential environmental risks and impacts of the Project will be related to construction of these facilities such as air pollution, soil, surface and ground water contamination. Operational impacts include occupational and community health and safety, and odor nuisance from landfills. These potential risks and impacts can be avoided, minimized or mitigated by adoption of the good engineering design as a first step, and application of mitigation measures identified in the ESIA which will be incorporated into the site-specific ESMP. The detailed design for all subproject areas will be further examined to incorporate the appropriate design measures to minimize environmental risks and impacts of the Project at an acceptable-level.Social:Project activities will be carried out in 20 ULBs where land is available. The land for the identified Project activities is currently under the ownership of Project ULB. No land acquisition is presently anticipated for the Project. The primary social impacts stemming from the Project include direct and indirect economic displacement of waste pickers and those who derive income from the landfills, especially during construction. Moreover, set-back area requirements around the landfill sites prescribed by the DoE may require additional and specific mitigating measures and plans to reduce the impacts to nearby communities. The Project also plans to upgrade selected access roads to the landfills, and the civil works for road rehabilitation will be confined to the RoW. It is anticipated that there will be a temporary loss of access and income for affected businesses residing along the proposed road segments.The Project is also likely to generate differentiated impacts on vulnerable groups, including women, children, and the elderly. Moreover, labor influx may heighten potential risks related to Gender-based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse/Sexual Harassment. The nature of the Project may also cause potential health risks to communities due to pollution of soil, water resources etc. The area surrounding the Project site is also likely to experience increased traffic flows.In order to mitigate negative impacts of the project, the site specific RLRP will include compensation and payment to the affected waste pickers and other entities; training opportunities; provision of employment opportunity in the recycling facility, and opportunity to work for the Project during construction of the landfill. Replacement costs for the affected structures and other entitlement for vangari shop structures and commercial establishment owners are also included as part of the entitlement matrix.The Project design also includes numeric targets for women and vulnerable groups, training and awareness-raising sessions as well as number of women who benefitted from the training. Currently waste pickers face health issues that leads to loss of working days and this project has included provisions for health screening and care to reduce adverse health impacts. Gender and Social Inclusion Plan (GSIP) is prepared, as part of the ESIA, providing specific actions to improve women and vulnerable groups’ participation in the project.Consultations and information disclosure:Several consultations, meetings, and focus group discussions (FGDs) with stakeholders were carried out for the Project, particularly during the preparation of the ESIA and RLRP. Continued consultations with Project-affected people, vulnerable groups, and communities will be conducted throughout the Project cycle. Documentation of all stakeholder engagement is included in the ESIA, which includes discussion on loss of land, structures, and livelihoods as well as Project impacts, perception, and benefits, among others. Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEP) have been also prepared for the four ULBs, as part of the ESIA, highlighting the steps for the succeeding consultations. Information dissemination sessions will be held at major intersections and different channels to raise awareness and encourage participation. The ESMPF, RPF, and ESIA have been disclosed on the government’s website. The executive summary of ESIA and the entitlement matrix of RPF/RLRP have been translated in Bengali. These documents have also been disclosed on the Bank’s website. Printed documents will be made available in the Project area.Monitoring and supervision arrangement:The Project Management Unit (PMU) will have the overall responsibility of results M&E for the Project. It will coordinate the collection of data and individual monitoring reports from Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and submit consolidated progress reports to AIIB periodically. AIIB will conduct onsite visit during project preparation and implementation. Detailed M&E arrangements with clearly defined roles and responsibilities as well as the templates for periodic and annual progress reports have been developed and included in the Project Implementation Manual.Grievance Redressal Mechanism:A two-tiered Project-specific and gender sensitive Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) will be established by the client to receive, acknowledge, evaluate and facilitate the resolution to the complaints relating to ES issues with corrective actions proposed, those issues raised from project-affected people (PAPs) as well as project contracted workers. In addition to this, each subproject under the Project will also be required to establish its GRM.

The environmental and social (E&S) instrument will be eWTP Arabia’s E&S Management System (ESMS), to be enhanced as required to be consistent with AIIB’s ESP.Based on the Bank’s ESP, eWTP Arabia’s ESMS which has to be further enhanced, includes an ESG Policy designed to (i) assign an E&S risk categorization, (ii) review E&S aspect to assess any material issues, (iii) monitor E&S risks and impacts of the investee companies and (v) report to its investment committee accordingly. A responsible officer has been appointed by the client to integrate the E&S consideration into investment process. The client is ready to hire an environmental consultant to help them revise the fund’s ESG policy and the operational tool to align with AIIB ESP requirement.The Fund’s indicative pipeline presents a variety in the level of E&S risks. Given the early stage of the  client’s ESMS, category A subprojects will be excluded. The client has a high level of climate commitment but has not expressed this commitment in a concrete strategy or action plan. The Project Team intends to follow the Paris Alignment BB1 transaction-based approach, to exclude subprojects that are not considered universally aligned with Paris Agreement goals and not in line with AIIB Energy Sector Strategy.As the client is still at the early stage of ESMS, it has not disclosed the ESMS related information yet. The Project Team will discuss with eWTPA to publish on its website a summarized version of its enhanced ESG policy and ESMS overview in a timely manner. eWTPA will be required to disclose the name, location and sectors of the sub-projects, within 12 months following financial close.  For all Higher Risk sub-projects, eWTPA will be required to disclose annual E&S documentation during the preceding 12 months, unless such disclosure is subject to the host country’s regulatory requirements, market sensitivities or consent of the sponsor. E&S documentation will be written in local language(s) and at least a summarized version in English, disclosed in a timely, accessible, gender sensitive and inclusive and culturally appropriate manner.During Project implementation, AIIB will conduct prior review of the first three higher risk subprojects to expedite the client’s compliance with AIIB’s E&S requirements and adequate in-house E&S capacity. AIIB will excuse itself from any higher risk subproject that do not align with AIIB’s ESS requirements. AIIB will require the submission of project appraisal forms, relevant E&S documentation, and semi-annual E&S monitoring reports from the Fund in an agreed format providing an update on the implementation of the enhanced ESMS, and a summary of the E&S performance of each subproject. AIIB will conduct post-reviews of the selection and implementation of subprojects as part of its regular supervision, comprising engagement with the Fund, potential site visits and detailed review of the E&S documentation of selected sub-projects.The Project Team is working with eWTPA to enhance its External Communication Mechanism (ECM) as the project level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM). The ECM will be made available to all stakeholders and will also provide information on AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM). In addition, under its enhanced E&S Policy, eWTPA will require each one of sub-projects to establish its GRM to receive and facilitate resolution of the concerns and complaints. Provision will also be made to inform Project-affected people and Project workers of their availability.",USD50 million,FI,OK

To ensure a harmonized approach in addressing the E&S risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB's ESP), EBRD’s ESP and relevant PRs will apply to this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed EBRD's ESP and relevant PRs and is satisfied that: (a) they are consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including AIIB's Environmental and Social Exclusion List and relevant Environmental and Social Standards; and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. EBRD has classified the Project as Category B (which is equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable) because the potential E&S risks and impacts likely to occur are mainly site-specific, reversible, and will be mitigated through implementation of proposed mitigation measures.Instruments.AnEnvironmental Impact Assessmentwas prepared in 2006 in line with the Egyptian Environmental Law and approved by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency. In April 2019, an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) for the Damietta Port was undertaken on behalf of EBRD. The ESDD identified the need for applying additional mitigation measures to address the likely impacts and enhance the E&S performance of the Damietta Port modernization. The additional mitigation measures are included in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) prepared to address the identified gaps in line with EBRD’s PRs requirements. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) outlining consultation and disclosure plan is being prepared to fulfill the requirements indicated in the ESAP.Environmental Aspects.The major environmental impacts will occur during the construction phase of the Project and include dust emissions from construction activities, water contamination, noise, waste and wastewater. An Environmental and Social Management Plan has been prepared to fulfil the requirements of the ESAP. As a condition precedent to the final approval of the Project, the Lenders’ E&S Advisor carried out a land and groundwater contamination survey, during the period of May and July 2023, to assess the need to treat the contaminants (if any) prior to disposal by DPA. Samples of dredged material excavated by DPA have been tested using both national and international standards, against the European Union Environmental Quality Standards in a saltwater environment and in line with the Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines for the protection of aquatic life as good international practices. The third-party results of the assessment have concluded the soil and sediment to be excavated from the proposed dock area would not pose a significant risk to human health or to the aquatic environment of the Mediterranean Sea.Social Aspects.The physical footprint of the Project is within the existing Damietta Port area and no additional land will be acquired for, or in connection with, the Project. DPA is planning for an expansion of the parking area at Damietta Port on adjacent land currently owned by Damietta Governorate. As a result of this land acquisition to be undertaken by DPA, six rice fields could face potential economic displacement. CT II does not expect to become a user of this additional parking area and, therefore, the Lenders’ E&S Advisor concluded that this potential expansion is not an associated facility to the Project. Were CT II to plan using the additional parking area in the future, a thorough assessment according to PS5 /PR5 shall be taken up when a decision is made to develop the parking area. Currently, limited impacts related to the surrounding fishing activities are expected due to setback requirements of 5 km from the boats to the shoreline. Nevertheless, prior to commencement of commercial operations, the Borrower will assign a qualified third-party consultant to assess the potential risks and impacts to the fishing stocks and recommend the required control measures, in line with the EBRD PRs, and commensurate with the Project risk and impacts, as part of the ESAP.Gender Aspects.The ESAP includes requirements to enhance the Borrower’s Human Resources Policy to include specific provisions to promote gender equality and prevention of Gender-based Violence and Harassment (GBVH). Additionally, the Project will support internship and apprenticeship opportunities for female students and graduates with the anticipated support of DPA. Furthermore, the Borrower will operationalize a women’s working group to empower women in engineering and technical roles. The Project will provide temporary on-site facilities for construction and permanent facilities for operation, including separate sanitation facilities for males and females to minimize risks related to GBVH.Community Health and Safety and Community Relations.Sensitive receptors were identified within a radius of 500 m to 1 km of the Damietta Port consisting of villages and residential households starting from Izbet Nasralla (20 m from the southern port perimeter), Izbet Khamesa (115 m from the western perimeter) and some small independent residences and farmhouses scattered around the port. The communities can be potentially affected by impacts including dust, noise, and vibration from construction vehicles, and communicable diseases associated with the influx of temporary construction labor. The Borrower will undertake a traffic risk and impact assessment, including route risk assessments, to minimize impacts to the surrounding communities, as part of the ESAP.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.A SEP outlining stakeholder consultation and disclosure plans is being prepared for the Project, including how stakeholder engagement will be carried out for the Project and how long-term relationships between the Borrower, DPA and the local communities are anticipated to be maintained. The ESAP includes key actions to be undertaken to implement the SEP and disclosure strategy of the Project. The English version of the ESAP and SEP and the Non-Technical Summaries in Arabic and English will be disclosed on the Borrower’s website and hard copies will be made available in the relevant public areas. In addition, the E&S instruments will be posted on the AIIB andEBRD’swebsites.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The Borrower is required to establish and operate a project-level GRM for the local communities and a project-level GRM for Project workers. In addition, the public consultation and disclosure process will be used to disseminate information about the project-level GRM and the Project’s Independent Accountability Mechanism of EBRD.

To address the problematic fiscal distortions in Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) decisions and public investment selection, the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan (MNE) established limits to state obligations in PPPs and other concessions, new rules for selection of concession projects. The Government also approved a new full-fledged and binding methodology to govern economic appraisal and prioritization of public investment proposals.To enhance fiscal transparency, the Parliament amended the Budget Code to impose the obligation for the government to disclose, with the annual budget submission to Parliament, a fiscal sustainability and risks assessment. Additionally, the GoK disclosed the first-ever fiscal sustainability and risks assessments to the Parliament, including a fiscal sustainability assessment component that also recognizes the long-term fiscal implications of decarbonization of the country’s economy.The GoK also updated the Family and Gender Policy 2030, approving a corresponding Action Plan that includes explicit high-level commitment and instructions to introduce gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) and implement GRB pilots based on gender needs assessment.To ensure medium-term debt sustainability, legal reforms were approved to establish legal authority for i) active liability management practices, ii) comprehensive debt analysis of all direct and contingent liabilities, and iii) issuance of strategic frameworks to govern debt management and market communication.Lastly, under Reform Area 1, the Government implemented energy efficiency improvement plans for social sectors and urban services and pilot green budget tagging to gradually enable an effective introduction of climate policy accounting and assessment concepts and instruments.Under Reform Area 2, the Program includes ambitious reforms to re-establish the loan origination capacity of the banking system and to make financial intermediation more sustainable and accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Kazakhstan. Overall, the Program strengthens the resilience of the financial system to external shocks. Legislative amendments and operational modifications were implemented to enhance the confidence in and the effectiveness of the deposit insurance safety net. Reforms also improved transparency with regards to non-performing loans (NPLs), created pre-conditions for the development of an active market for Non-Performing Assets as a mechanism to eliminate bad asset legacies from past macro shocks and to enable faster recoveries by the financial system in the future. To promote sustainable banking practices, the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan (ARDFM) developed regulatory recommendations on the disclosure of information about the degree of exposure to ESG-related risks, as well as the procedure for identifying, assessing, and managing such risks in accordance with international ESG disclosure standards.",,Category C,OK

An E&S risk assessment on the policy matrix was also undertaken, along with E&S due diligence, to confirm no outstanding E&S issues remain and to provide guidance on the E&S aspects for future reforms of state-owned enterprises.Data from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) show that Indonesia had 64.2 million business units in 2018, of which 99.9% were MSMEs. Micro enterprises make up 98.7% of the total, while 1.2% are small enterprises, and 0.1% are medium-sized enterprises. Government contracts have been awarded to only 0.26% of these SMEs, with even lower levels for women-owned SMEs as they generally have more restricted access to financial resources. A 2021 presidential regulation set a minimum of 40% of government procurement spending on MSMEs and cooperative domestic products. However, data on cooperatives and MSMEs, including WOB (Women-owned Business), are still disorganized and non-uniform, which has compromised the effectiveness of empowerment programs for cooperatives and MSMEs. To address this, The Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, in collaboration with Statistics Indonesia and supported by the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS), is conducting an exercise called Complete Data Collection on Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, 2022–2024.The program addresses gender-related constraints through the (i) implementation of a program to support the participation of WOB in government procurement, including gender-responsive procurement training and annual reporting on and identifying areas for strengthening the participation of WOB in government procurement; (ii) establishment of an inter-ministerial committee, chaired by the minister of cooperatives and SMEs with committee members including the minister of women empowerment and child protection, to improve the delivery of government services to enterprises; and (iii) development of an integrated MSME system, with sex-disaggregated data, for monitoring and reporting on the performance of WOB.

Aside from the economic contraction, the pandemic also resulted in significant social sector losses which mostly affected the poorest and most vulnerable. For the country to achieve economic recovery that is resilient, and inclusive, there is a need to focus on new development drivers including digitalization.Digitalization has a large potential to increase productivity by reducing firms’ operational costs and allowing them to reap economies of scale. First, digitalization can increase the efficiency and transparency of government services and empower its constituents, especially those previously distant from the center of decision-making. Digital platforms and services offer great potential for helping build resilience and preparedness against future crises and for mitigating and adapting to climate change (World Bank Development Committee paper, 2022). Second, digital finance is a key enabler of financial inclusion and women’s empowerment. Third, aggregate productivity can be raised by facilitating new and emerging firms to enter markets through disruptive innovations. Finally, digitalization expands firms’ market access as it decreases information constraints and transaction costs, which are particularly binding for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Higher operational efficiency and access to wider and more diversified markets, in turn, render firms more resilient against shocks.The DPF builds on the nation’s long-term vision articulated in “AmBisyon Natin 2040”, and the recently launched Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 to achieve inclusive growth. It is structured along the following three thematic pillars:- Pillar A: Improve digital government service delivery, and pro-competition infrastructure policies.- Pillar B: Expand financial inclusion for individuals and businesses through digital finance.- Pillar C: Boost business growth in digital services.","This Program will be co-financed with the WB as lead co-financier, and the Program’s environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the WB’s Policy on Development Policy Financing (DPF Policy).AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to DPF operations. Therefore, as permitted by the decision of the AIIB’s Board of Directors, the WB’s DPF Policy will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will provide for a harmonized approach to addressing the E&S risks and impacts of the Program.The WB has reviewed the specific policies under the Program to determine whether they are likely to have significant social and poverty consequences (especially on the poor and vulnerable groups) or to cause significant effects on the country’s environment, forests, and other natural resources. The WB has determined that these policies are likely to have positive overall environmental and social effects, as described in its Program Document. The reforms in Pillar A will have significant positive effects on poverty reduction by expanding access to digital services to the poor, creating opportunities, and protecting the poor against natural disasters and other shocks. Reforms under Pillar B will have significant positive effects on poverty reduction increasing the availability of and access to funds through increased outreach, financial market products, and long-term saving, particularly for women-owned Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. For Pillar C, increasing the competitiveness of digitally-led industries is expected to benefit poorer consumers and entrepreneurs.The preliminary assessment suggests that policy reforms supported under the DPF will likely bring positive effects on the environment, forest, and other natural resources. The reforms to promote efficient and inclusive government service delivery through the digitalization of government operations and improved digital infrastructure policies will likely lead to positive environmental outcomes. The expansion of financial inclusion for individuals and firms through digital finance will likely bring positive environmental effects. The reform that seeks to promote e-commerce uptake will likely increase the environmental footprint, but it can be partially mitigated through the country’s robust environmental policy framework.The program aims to reduce the gender gap in digital payments, where 43 percent of men made at least one digital payment compared to 34 percent for women based on latest Global Findex 2021.  Recognizing skills courses in higher education is expected to benefit women who often have additional commitments and career interruptions, enabling them to acquire skills for flexible and home-based work and re-enter the labor force after breaks. In addition, reforms that increase access to digital markets can help women-owned enterprises and SMEs gain a larger market share, while improvements in the digital services ecosystem can also contribute to reducing the gender gap.",,Category C,OK

Shokpar WPP will add an extra 22 turbines (100 MWe) to the same location in the adjacent land plot and will utilize much of the same infrastructure including the same Opornaya substation via a 220 kV transmission line. The Project is expected to generate direct and indirect adverse impacts on biodiversity during construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning, as manifested through dust emissions, habitat fragmentation, noise, solid waste, wastewater, etc. The major potential impacts include bird and bat collision-related fatalities, noise, and shadow flickering during the operational phase. In addition, the location of the operational turbines may represent a barrier to migratory species.The Project is part of Kazakhstan’s wind energy development that involves other WPPs in the same region, and it can cause cumulative impacts. Shokpar WPP will adopt a practice of adaptive management in which the implementation of mitigation and management measures are responsive to changing conditions and the results of monitoring throughout the Project’s lifecycle. The mitigation strategy will be commensurate with the project risks and impacts, including the cumulative impacts, so that the provisions of PR6 “Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources” are met and will take a risk-averse approach that explicitly identifies and accommodates uncertainty about the outcomes of mitigation measures.Adverse impacts can also result from associated facilities, particularly overhead transmission lines and access roads. Overall environmental impacts associated with the extension of the existing WPP are site-specific and readily assessed based on the ESDD and can be mitigated via ESAP implementation and provision of adequate management resources to address identified ES impacts.Biodiversity.The ESDD included a biodiversity risk analysis based on EBRD’s PR 6 and, similar to the Zhanatas Wind Farm, the results confirmed that the wind farm is not located in any ES sensitive areas, and there are no protected or designated nature reserves within a 30 km radius of the Project. The birds’ main migratory pathways are found within about 25-30 km north of the Project area. The area's ecological value is considered to be relatively low with the vegetation and animals typical for the waterless zones of the steppe. The potential risk of collision and/or electrocution impacts from the turbines and power lines is not likely to be very significant as long as mitigation measures for collision and electrocution impacts, such as a Biodiversity Management and Monitoring Plan and the collision risk modeling, are incorporated in the ESAP and Project design.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.The Project site is located in a continental zone with large daily and annual air temperature fluctuations (-8°C and -32°C during winter and 34°C to 45°C during summer). Temperatures in Kazakhstan are projected to rise at a faster rate than the global average and faster than most other Asian nations and has a potential warming of 5.3°C by the 2090s. Climate change is expected to cause droughts, land degradation, desertification, and associated events such as dust storms.The turbines to be installed in the Project can withstand high temperatures and they will be equipped with cold type temperature package to withstand low temperatures during winters. The ESAP requires the client to monitor ice build-up on the wind turbines and consider anti-icing measures.The Project contributes to Kazakhstan’s National Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce GHG emissions and increase the uptake ofrenewable energy. Based on the activity type (wind power generation), AIIB's entire financing for the Project can be counted as climate mitigation finance. Additionally, the Project contributes to adaptation finance since WPPs consume almost no water, and when added to the grid, they displace water intensive thermal power production. It is aligned with national adaptation/resilience pathway under the2030 Water Resource Management Strategyas it will support country’s water conservation efforts. In water scarce contexts such as in Kazakhstan, the displaced energy and associated water consumption are material for the climate resilience of the country through avoided water consumption (analogous to avoided GHG emissions).Social aspects.The Project Developer has completed the land acquisition process for the plots under wind turbine generators (WTGs) and reached easement agreements for the land leases under the 220kV transmission power line route through voluntary negotiations with the landowners. The Project has been prepared in accordance with national regulations and is not expected to cause physical or economic displacement in the form of loss of livelihood. Currently, the Project area is mainly used for grazing nomadic animals (horses, sheep, goats). The Project would have a minimal impact as these activities can be continued on the adjacent available land. Community and livelihood impacts were also analyzed, and it has been identified that they are mainly associated with increased traffic during construction and visual effects, which are considered negligible. Social, labor, and safety aspects during construction and operation were analyzed.Several recommendations were presented to the EPC contractor to strengthen its institutional capacity to manage ES risks during the construction and operational phases and deliver the Project in line with EBRD's PRs. Moreover in order to enhance women’s access to economic opportunities, the client with the cooperation of stakeholders aims to carry out a number of tasks, including establishment of training and internship program for high school and university students, cooperate/partner with local educational providers to improve the perception and awareness of the employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for young women and men in the renewable energy sector; and contribute to the development of a vocational guidance and employment programs in order to increase the number of women entrants in vocational educational programs. In order to mitigate the adverse impacts of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Shokpar will develop a worker Code of Conduct, including GBV mitigation measures, and require its contractors to apply the Code, with penalties leading up to dismissal.Gender Aspects.To support women’s access to economic opportunities in the renewables energy sector in Kazakhstan, Shokpar, with the assistance of the EBRD Gender and Inclusion team and in coordination with other stakeholders, plans to (i) establish a training/cooperation program and provide training and internship opportunities as well as career advice to not less than 25 female high school and university students over the period of the loan and contribute to the Renewable Energy Internship/Apprenticeship Programme (REIAP) that will be established by the EBRD; (ii) cooperate/partner with local educational providers to improve the perception and awareness of the employment and entrepreneurship opportunities for young women and men in the renewable energy sector; and (iii) contribute to the development of a vocational guidance and employment programs in order to increase the number of women entrants in vocational educational programs.As part of EBRD's PR 10 “Information Disclosure and Stakeholder Engagement”, the Project used different engagement methods based on gender, age, and ethnicity aspects. As part of the actions to mitigate Gender-Based Violence (GBV) defined by the ESAP, Shokpar will develop a worker Code of Conduct, including GBV mitigation measures, and requires it to contractors to enforce the Code, with penalties leading up to dismissal. The EPC Contractor needs to consult with local authorities and community leaders so that the project managers are aware of incidents and can take appropriate action if the issue arises.Cultural Heritage.During the EIA process, the presence of archaeological/cultural heritage objects was identified within the Project allocated land plots. The archaeological survey of the Project area confirmed the presence of two cultural heritage objects, namely (i) Aktogay Burial Ground (dated appr. IV-I cent. BC) and (ii) an ancient settlement Syzdykbaeva (est. ~40sq.m; dated appr. IV-I cent. BC). Following the local legislative requirements, the Project Company submitted the findings of the archaeology survey report to obtain a formal Archaeological Expertise conclusion. The archaeological finds have been collected from both sites and are currently temporarily stored at LLC Archaeological Expertise awaiting the Ministry of Culture and Sport’s decision regarding to which museum the findings should be delivered for collection and exhibition. In July 2020, the Project Company received a formal expertise conclusion stating that the cultural objects identified during the survey are not culturally and/or historically significant, and therefore, the area is not restricted for further development activities.Shokpar and the EPC Contractor and those of its subcontractors that are engaged in activities on-site must develop a clear Chance Find procedure provide for relevant personnel among contractors to be trained in its use. This document will establish the procedure for actions in case of discovering objects that are classified as having archaeological importance. Such discoveries of suspected archaeological value must be immediately reported to the construction managers and the social/environmental manager who must then report the findings to the relevant authorities.Labor and Working Conditions and Supply Chain.The Project will be co-financed with EBRD and AIIB will follow the approach as that adopted by the EBRD in addressing potential issues arising from labor and working conditions in the supply chain. Enhanced supply chain due diligence has been conducted in order to assess the working conditions and labor risks at the selected production facility, where the wind turbines are being assembled by Shokpar’s supplier. In addition to the labor audit at the facility level, a risk screening of the core/primary suppliers to Shokpar's supplier was conducted to review potential issues relating to labor and working conditions at the potential supplier/vendor level. The findings of the labor audit and supplier risk screening will inform the corrective actions on the improvement of the supplier management and traceability system for the Project and will be included in the Project's ESAP, supplemented by Shokpar's and its supplier's commitments on labor and working conditions in their supply chains.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Stakeholder engagement confirmed support for the Project and limited concern about its potential impacts. Shokpar has engaged with stakeholders to provide inputs into the Project design. Key issues/concerns raised by local communities during public hearings included the issue of noise as a result of construction activities; another aspect was the expectations from local residents for job opportunities during the construction phase of the Project. To facilitate a meaningful consultation process with Project stakeholders, including affected people and third parties, project summary information in English, Kazakh and Russian is disclosed on EBRD’s website (KAZREF II - Shokpar Wind (ebrd.com)). An NTS and SEP in English, Kazakh, and Russian is disclosed by the Borrower on itswebsite. In addition to those documents, the ESAP in English has been disclosed on AIIB’s website (Kazakhstan: Shokpar 100MW Wind Power Project - Projects - AIIB).Community and Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.As part of the ESAP, the mitigation of community health and safety risks will be defined in the Construction Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan (C-ESMMP) to be prepared before the financial close. This will cover labor and working conditions of contractors and sub-contractors and management of infectious diseases, including COVID-19.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A Project-level GRM has been established by Shokpar. It will disseminate information about the GRM at the Project level for stakeholders including local communities and Project-affected people (PAPs) in accordance with EBRD’s PR10 “Information Disclosure and Stakeholder Engagement” requirements. The information on the Project-level GRM and EBRD’s independent accountability mechanism will be disclosed in Russian/Kazakh in a timely and appropriate manner. The EPC Contractor will also be required to log in all complaints on site. Access to the project-level GRM will be free of cost.Monitoringand Supervision Arrangements. Monitoring and supervision missions will be carried out annually. Site visits to verify implementation of ESAP will be carried out jointly by the lender group. ES monitoring reports will be prepared annually by Shokpar based on an agreed format.",,Category B,OK

By implementing such a plan, the Province can diversify its energy supply mix, improve energy efficiency, reduce gas consumption and achieve its goal of clean energy transition.Partnering with CAF who will support the modernization of the two thermal power plants, AIIB will support the construction of a wind farm located in Río Grande. The AIIB loan is expected to finance: (1) the procurement, transportation and installation of eight wind power turbines, with an individual capacity of 4.2 MW for each turbine and a total installed capacity of 33.6MW; (2) the interconnection line to the 33Kv local electric power distribution system (including fiber-optic cable network); (3) project feasibility studies.","Environment and Social Policy and Categorization.AIIB's Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List, apply to the Projects. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is triggered for the Project. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) and ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is under consideration pending further field assessment. Based on the likely environmental impacts, the Project is currently assigned Category B, and the categorization will be confirmed following field review.Instruments.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is under preparation in line with Argentinian regulations. In addition, AIIB will develop an Environmental and Social Due Diligence Report (ESDD) to address identified gaps with AIIB's ESP. The EIA include an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) to manage environmental and social risks and impacts. In addition, a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) will be prepared.Environmental Aspects.The Project is expected to generate direct and indirect adverse impacts on biodiversity during construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning, manifested through dust emissions, habitat fragmentation, light spill, noise, solid waste, wastewater, etc. The major impacts include bird and bat collision-related fatalities, noise, and shadow flickering during the operational phase. In addition, the location of operational turbines may represent a barrier to the migratory species. Adverse impacts can also result from associated facilities, particularly overhead transmission lines and access roads. This Project is part of the wind energy development that involves other wind power plants in the same region, and it can cause cumulative impacts. These impacts are assessed in the respective ESIAs, and appropriate mitigation measures will be included in the respective ESMPs. The spatial context around the project site was assessed to analyze the potential impacts on avifauna, including one Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA), Reserva Costa Atlántica de Tierra del Fuego y zonas Adyacentes, within 10 km of the Rio Grande wind farm site and the Transmission Line, and a Critical Habitat Assessment (""CHA"") will be prepared as part of the EIA.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.The GHG emission avoidance from renewable energy generation will be estimated in the climate risk assessment as part of the ESIA. The Project contributes to Argentina's NDC to reduce GHG emissions and increase the uptake of renewable energy. Based on the activity type (wind power generation), AIIB's entire financing for the Project can be counted as climate mitigation finance. A climate vulnerability assessment will integrate adaptive measures into the project design to mitigate climate risks (floods, storms, etc.).Social Aspects.The land where the Project will be developed is located in an unpopulated area currently owned by the Salesian congregation and that will be transferred to the Province on a willing seller willing buyer basis. Therefore, the construction of the Project will not lead to physical displacement. Economic displacement is also not expected. The construction of the OHTL may lead to limited economic displacement.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, Information Disclosure and Monitoring.During the ESDD and SEP preparation, meaningful consultations and stakeholder engagement will be conducted with local communities. The English version of the environmental and social (E&S) instruments and the summaries of those both in Spanish and English will be disclosed online and made available in the project area. In addition, the documents will be posted on the Bank's website. Appropriate monitoring arrangements will be discussed with the Client during project appraisal. The Bank will carry out field-based E&S monitoring missions.Community and Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.As part of the ESMP, the mitigation of community health and safety risks will be defined in the Occupational Health and Safety Management Plan (OHSMP) to be prepared at the start of the construction and operational phases, including a Worker Influx Management Plan. In addition, the EPC Contractor and O&M provider will prepare a Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment (SEA/SH) Prevention and Response Action Plan, Human Resources Policy (and related procedures), Retrenchment Plan, and Human Rights Policy.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.The Project Company will establish and operate a project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) for the local communities and a project-level GRM for Project workers.

The relevant ESG Framework is Bayfront’s E&S Framework, developed under the Infrastructure Private Capital Mobilization Platform with inputs from AIIB as a minority equity investor, and is consistent with the spirit and vision of AIIB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF).Bayfront has developed and maintained (1) anEnvironmental & Social (E&S) Frameworkwhich serves as the basis for a robust E&S due diligence for every loan and bond acquisition, (2)Climate Risk Assessmentwhich is evaluated for every loan and bond investment to identify and assess physical risk, transition risk and financed carbon emissions intensity; and (3)Sustainable Finance Frameworkwhich provides the basis for issuance of green, social or sustainability notes. The Project involves a potential investment into an issuance of IABS, which includes a sustainability tranche. The proceeds from the sustainability tranche will be used to finance and/or refinance the purchase of assets for renewable energy, energy efficiency, affordable social infrastructure and other eligible projects.1) The E&S Framework, which would apply to the entire operation, includes criteria to (i) evaluate the E&S performance of each underlying asset and its key counterparties in the portfolio (including E&S related reputational risks) as part of the initial red flags screening, (ii) screen against Bayfront’s E&S exclusion list (which is consistent with the Bank’s Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL)), (iii) categorization and an E&S risk rating, which determines the extent of monitoring and oversight required post-acquisition, and sector specific E&S risks that needs to be addressed by Sector Guides. Coal mining, coal transport and coal-fired power plants, or infrastructure services exclusively dedicated to support any of those activities are part of Bayfront’s E&S exclusion list.2) The Climate Risk Assessment framework, which would apply to the entire operation, includes criteria to evaluate each loan and bond investment using (i) a climate risk scorecard that identifies, evaluates and scores the physical risks and transition risks of each asset; and (ii) computation of financed carbon emissions intensity covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for each asset and for the entire assets under management (AUM) of Bayfront’s aggregate portfolio, either using obligors’ disclosure (where available) or revenue-based emission factors for different industry sub-sectors. The latter helps Bayfront to track its progress against its stated climate ambition of achieving Net Zero financed emissions for aggregate AUMs by 2050.3) The Sustainable Finance Framework, which would apply to the sustainability tranche of this operation, has been reviewed and a Second Party Opinion (SPO) has been provided for alignment with key International Capital Market Association (ICMA) guidelines including Green Bond Principles 2021 (with June 2022 Appendix 1), Social Bond Principles 2023 and Sustainable Bond Guidelines 2021. The initial aggregate par amount of Eligible Assets exceeds the proposed principal amount of the sustainability tranche and investment into these sustainable assets will contribute towards the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Bayfront has in place agrievance redress mechanism(GRM) in conjunction with its parent company, Clifford Capital Holdings Group, to provide a forum for stakeholders, including project-affected people (PAPs) and project contracted workers, to raise E&S concerns. Under the E&S Framework, Bayfront requires and acquires loans or bonds financing projects which have established and suitable asset-level GRMs or equivalent and inform people in the project’s footprint about its availability. The information of Bayfront’s GRM including asset-level GRMs will be disclosed timely in an appropriate manner. The GRM will receive and facilitate resolution of the concerns and complaints of people who believe that they have been adversely affected by the asset’s E&S impacts.During project administration, AIIB may request E&S performance information of the portfolio and Bayfront’s climate commitments and strategy, including an update on the implementation of the E&S Framework and an E&S portfolio summary. All investors will receive the annual sustainability tranche post-issuance impact report including total amount of proceeds allocated to eligible assets, number of eligible assets and others.

Despite its strong performance, the original Program has been impacted by challenges experienced in 2022, such as high food and fuel prices. The challenges led GOJ to reallocate fiscal resources to social protection and subsidies at the cost of capital spending. Also, timebound DLRs on investment incentives and promotion should be revised to align with the enacted legal provisions of the 2022 Investment Environment law and 2023 subsidiary legislation, including with regard to targeted investment incentives to promote participation of Jordanian women in the workforce. In October 2022, the Government of Jordan requested AIIB to provide an AF of USD200 million to scale up the operation and restructure the original Program in light of the recent institutional reorganization and policy shifts in the past year. In parallel, the Government requested for USD 400 million from the World Bank, the lead co-financier of the original Program. The Loan from the World Bank was already approved in April 2023.The proposed AF aims to enhance the development effectiveness and fiscal sustainability of public investment, to increase support to climate responsive public and private investment, including by mobilizing green financing and climate finance, to create job and business opportunities for women, and to improve government effectiveness and social accountability through participatory policy making based on data. It is highly aligned with the Government’s strategy and will call for a significant increase in both public and private investment, especially in green and climate friendly areas, making the economy more resilient.","This AF will be co-financed with the World Bank as lead co-financier, and its environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the World Bank’s Policy on Program for Results (PforR Policy).To provide for a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the original Program and AF, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the World Bank’s PforR Policy has been applied to the original Program and will also be applicable to this AF operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP.

ADB has categorized the ES risks of the project as Category B for Environment, B for Involuntary Resettlement and B for Indigenous Peoples, as it is likely to have ES impacts that are site-specific, few if any of them are irreversible, and in most cases, mitigation measures can be designed and implemented. This is equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable.The main and more complex adverse impacts of the Project will come from operation phase versus construction phase. Activities at the project site during construction stage may generate solid waste, wastewater, noise, air emission and soil erosion, and disturbance to nearby residents and potentially pollute water bodies, disturbing local ecology, and local physical cultural resources. The potential risks include (i) wastewater and the adequate treatment and slurry discharge/use; (ii) solid and hazardous wastes, their management and disposal; (iii) odor and air emissions; and (iv) health and safety including biosafety risks. These impacts have been assessed and corresponding mitigation plans include operation and maintenance of properly designed waste treatment facilities, monitoring of wastewater discharges, and implementation of generally accepted procedures for handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. These were incorporated in the Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.A Resettlement Framework (RF) was prepared to outline potential adverse impacts relating to permanent and temporary, physical, and economic displacement of both titleholders and non-titleholders and to propose mitigation measures. RF has been disclosed and it outlines the resettlement policy principles, procedures, and institutional arrangements to mitigate risks and offer sustainable livelihood and development opportunities to the people affected by the Project. ADB has categorized this project as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender analysis carried out as part of project preparation has identified and assessed (i) strengths and weaknesses with regard to gender and social inclusion issues in the Cambodian livestock subsector; (ii) gender context in livestock value chain; and (iii) gender dynamics in the livestock value chain. A gender equality and social inclusion action plan inclusive of a monitoring plan has been prepared to manage the challenges identified during the gender analysis anddisclosed here.Prepared ES documents have been disclosed onADB’s website,AIIB’s websiteand theGovernment’s website. Moreover, semi-annual ES monitoring reports will be provided by the client to AIIB for review, and the Bank retains rights to conduct field supervision in the course of the Project implementation along with ADB.A project-specific Grievance Readiness Mechanism (GRM) will be established to receive, acknowledge, evaluate and facilitate the resolution of the complaints relating to ES issues with corrective actions proposed. This will be undertaken using understandable and transparent processes that are gender-responsive, culturally appropriate and readily accessible to all segments of the affected people. In addition, the GRM will be established in each target province and each project site. Records of grievances received, corrective actions taken, and their outcomes shall be properly maintained. The information on project-specific GRM and ADB’s independent accountability mechanism (IAM) will be disclosed to local stakeholders and the project-affected people in an appropriate and timely manner.",,Category B,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) will be triggered on account of the potential additional land requirements for the project and Associated Facilities. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not be applicable to the project as the project affected area does not contain distinct social and cultural group(s) possessing the distinct characteristics as per ESS 3. The project has been assigned Category A, given the potential Environmental and Social (E&S) impacts and risks related to the large-scale construction and adverse noise impacts are expected to be substantial.Instruments.The Client prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Stability Risk Assessment (SSRA) report in Chinese language in line with national legislation and requirements, which had been approved by Yunnan Governmental Authorities concerned in Dec 2022 and July 2022 respectively. The SSRA concluded the Social Stability Risk for this overall Project as ""low risk"". All project activities and identified Associated Facilities (AFs) have been assessed according to the ESP. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) have also been prepared to address the gaps with respect to AIIB's ESP in assessment and mitigation of potential E&S impacts and risks. An Environmental and Social Audit Report (ESAR) for existing operations of Changshui Airport has been prepared and an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) has been agreed to implement the mitigation measures in this regard. In addition, an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan (ARP) has been prepared to address the project footprint land acquisition and resettlement, while a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) is prepared for the project activities whose details are not yet fully identified or designs not yet finalized. This RPF also addresses the noise induced relocation aspects.Environment.The major environmental impacts related to air transport are cumulative noise impact, solid waste (including hazard waste) and wastewater. Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool screening indicates that three Protected Areas are found within a 50 km radius of the project area, including the Dianchi Scenic Area at one kilometer from the Project Site. However, based on the fauna surveys and the bird monitoring data from the ESIA, there is no indicative risk of significant migratory birds present, affecting the airport expansion or future operation. For the construction phase, the Project will have conventional construction-related risks and impacts manifested through dust emissions, water contamination, noise, removal of construction debris, etc. Based on national regulation, new constructions around the airport area will be limited and shall include noise insulation measures limiting the in-house exposure to operational aircraft noise. The Project's main operational E&S risk concerns noise impacts on the residential and sensitive receptors close to the airport and mitigation measures based on a balanced approach will minimize the potential impacts on residents' health and represent an improvement in the current situation. YAG has committed to implementing an action plan with local authorities based on a Noise Management Framework (NMF), which applies International Civil Aviation Organization's Balanced Approach to Aeronautical Noise Management. All these impacts and identified gaps in mitigation measures will be managed through the implementation of prepared ESMP and ESAP as well as good international practice.Social.Key social risks associated with the Project are related to the physical and/or economic displacements by land acquisition and the noise induced physical relocation. No residential houses will be required to be acquired or demolished for the Project works footprint. Among 213.82 mu land to be acquired, only 4.05 mu is cultivated land, and most part of the remaining land is collective ecological forest land. It is estimated that the land use affects three families with thirteen people. This process of land taken in 2015 is reviewed for any outstanding legacy issues during the appraisal through land use due diligence. The ESIA identified legacy issues related to noise impacts that will be managed through the ESIA, NMF, and RPF, including mitigation measures for soundproof windows, noise monitoring systems, and the institutional arrangements necessary to address the mitigation actions related to resettlement of the affected people. Land requirement process for the Project and AFs is evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures primarily to restore and/or improve the livelihoods of Project-affected people (PAPs) has been addressed through the ARP.Gender.YAG has standardized the Special Contract for the Protection of Rights and Interests of Female Employees, which guarantees the rights and interests of labor, personal and educational development of female employees. Measures for the prevention of Sexual Harassment in the construction and operation processes has been strengthened under ESMP. In addition, risks of Gender-based violence (GBV) and related social tensions due to labor influx were evaluated and informed in preparing dedicated mitigation measures, such as Gender Action Plan (GAP), which has been developed to ensure women’s engagement and development.Consultations, information disclosure and monitoring.During project preparation, consultations on E&S impacts were conducted with communities and PAPs around the project areas including meetings with low-income residents, farmers, women, ethnic minorities, village committee and government representatives. Further community participation plan during the project implementation stage is designed and included in updated SEP. A coordination/consultation mechanism for E&S activities has been established between the steering committee/provincial government, YAG and the Dianzhong New Area Management Committee. The SEP provides detailed plan for this process which will also publicize the ESP and the Project-Affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of the Bank in an appropriate manner. Following E&S instruments were disclosed on the YAG and AIIB's website on April 10, 2023: (i) English version of ESIA, SEP, RPF, ESAP and their non-Technical Summaries (NTS) in Chinese; and (ii) national EIA (in Chinese) exclusive of sensitive information if applied and its NTS in English. The Bank will carry out field-based E&S supervision during project implementation. YAG/Project Implementing Agency (PIA) will be responsible for overall coordination, supervision and monitoring of the project’s compliance with E&S matters. PIA will submit regular E&S monitoring reports to AIIB during project implementation based on agreed format. For the first year of construction stage of project, PIA shall submit quarterly reports, and based on the E&S performance and in agreement with the Bank, semi-annual reports will be submitted thereafter. Third-party ES monitoring and reporting will be conducted at least once every year during the project period. A third-party ES Audit will be conducted before the Project Close Date, and PIA will follow and implement the recommendations of the Audit and Project Completion Note, especially those related to the RPF and NMF.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The existing public and employee complaints mechanisms are reviewed and based on that, a multi-tier Project-level GRM, along with a separate mechanism to address workplace complaints and concerns, has been established in accordance with the requirements of AIIB's ESP.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) apply to the Project. ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) will not apply to this project based on the social assessment carried out during project preparation. The project has been identified as Category A, based on the available information, particularly considering the anticipated scale and impacts of Land Acquisition and Resettlement (LAR).1. Environmental and Social Instruments.An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) have been prepared together during project preparation to assess the environmental and social (E&S) impacts. On this basis, an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) have also been prepared to propose mitigation measures for project-related environmental and social issues during the project implementation and operational phases, including identification of such measures, and the requirements for monitoring, and supervision. LAR due diligence report (DDR) as part of RAP has been prepared for the project components where land has been acquired prior to project preparation, to ensure any legacy issues can be well addressed prior to civil works. For collective farming and urban organic agriculture, a land use right transfer framework (LURTF) has been prepared and attached in the RAP as an appendix to ensure the process follows good practices on voluntary land use, e.g., meaningful consultation; voluntary agreements; establishment and operation of grievance redress mechanism; record keeping; and verification and monitoring. In addition, a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been developed to support consultation and communication throughout the Project cycle systematically. All E&S documentation including EIA, SIA, ESMP, RAP and SEP has been disclosed on both AIIB and the client’s website.2. Environmental Aspects.The Project will contribute to carbon sequestration and improvement of eco-system services through afforestation, the rehabilitation of the Huang Yang and the Han Jiang Rivers, and wetlands. Based on the preliminary review, no key biodiversity area is within 50 km of the project site, and the Project is not located in any existing or planned protected area. No dredging activity in the watercourse of both the Han Jiang River and the Huang Yang River. The Project is not located in any existing or planned protected area. One of the key protection priorities in the project area of influence is the Han Jiang River, which serves as a national level drinking water protection area.3. Biodiversity.The major potential adverse impacts of the Project may include biodiversity and ecosystem in the project area of influence, especially project activities that will modify the habitat and large scale of the plantation. The project has identified the Han Jiang wetland as conservation priority, all project activities will avoid the Han Jiang wetland per national regulation on ecological redline. The project has further carefully assessed alternatives for the green corridor and has minimized the scale of human intervention to project areas with good ecological status and selected the eco-friendly embankment. A preliminary plantation plan has been reviewed by experts to avoid any invasive species. The project has identified national important flora species in the Huang Yang River and Han Jiang River areas, a translocation plan will be implemented to achieve no loss target.4. Other expected impacts are generally localized, and will include dust and emissions from construction vehicles, construction noise, disturbance to the traffic, soil erosion, and wastewater and solid wastes generated during construction. The Project has identified protecting the Han Jiang River as the top priority and avoiding any negative impact on the river, other adverse impacts including any potential impacts to Wangwan Water Plant at the Huang Yang river will be mitigated through the implementation of the ESMP.5. Paris Alignment Assessment.Project Component 1 and Component 2 aim to enhance climate resilience and provide nature-based solutions for climate adaptation. The project will prepare climate change risk assessment based on different climate scenarios to better inform project design. The new road and road expansion will greatly alleviate the congestion in Ankang City, with all the low-carbon features mentioned in paragraph 40, it is considered Paris Aligned with mitigation goal. For Component 3, as the building is seeking an equivalent international green building, it is considered as Paris Aligned with mitigation goal.6. Social Aspects.Key social risks associated with the project are related to land acquisition and physical and/or economic displacements. In total, 1,093.89 mu of land will be acquired, 608.16 mu of which is currently being cultivated. In addition to this, some rural houses will be demolished and temporary land will be occupied. This will directly affect 1,098 households and 3,971 individuals across nine villages/communities. The Project will utilize 3,053.3 mu of farmland and forest land, involving 1,430 households. These leased lands will be used for sustainable organic farming and will not alter the original land use objectives. Furthermore, for lands that were acquired before project preparation adequate compensation and rehabilitation will be provided based on established national laws, local regulations, and AIIB’s ESP. A detailed RAP has been prepared based on the magnitude of impact, social economic survey, and extensive consultations among affected people and communities. A LURTF has been included as an appendix of the RAP to guide the land leasing process during project implementation. The framework ensures that the process is conducted voluntarily, fairly, and with equal participation from all parties involved. For the outstanding issues related to past LAR, the client has developed time-bound corrective actions and incorporated them into the RAP as well.7. Indigenous Peoples.No ethnic minorities concentrated communities are in the project area. The Project is not expected to have any impact on indigenous peoples/ethnic minority groups or communities in the project area as described in ESS 3.8. Community health and safety (CHS), Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), and Labor and Working Conditions.To ensure community well-being and comply with health and safety requirements, the PMO and PIU will outline necessary measures in the bidding documents. These measures will address health and safety requirements for contractors. Strategies in the ESMP will enhance community resilience for natural disasters, specifically flooding risks. The PMO and PIU will oversee the implementation of these strategies. They will also ensure that civil works contractors and main suppliers adhere to labor laws and regulations, and adopt codes of conduct regarding labor and working conditions.9. Gender and Social Inclusion Aspects.The Project will promote gender equality, social inclusion, and diversity. To determine the potential effects on women and vulnerable populations, a gender analysis and vulnerability assessment have been carried out. The improved infrastructure and living conditions will primarily benefit women and the elderly residing in the project area. All public facilities within the project will be made accessible for individuals with disabilities. Women will be given priority for job opportunities. Training and awareness initiatives will be implemented to encourage gender mainstreaming and social inclusion. Measures for preventing and managing Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Harassment (GBV/SH) risks can be found in the ESMP.10. Cultural Aspects.A cultural heritage assessment conducted in EIA during preparation confirmed that there are no cultural heritage sites in the project area, such as archaeological sites, historical buildings, or other cultural assets. However, Chance Find Procedure for culture heritages has been developed and incorporated into the ESMP to ensure that any unexpected discoveries of cultural heritage during the project implementation will be appropriately managed and protected.11. Stakeholder Engagement and Monitoring.During project preparation and implementation, it is crucial to engage with stakeholders, particularly those who are directly impacted. Consultations were conducted throughout the preparation of various E&S documents, with two-way communication occurring at two different stages. Additionally, discussions took place with village/community leaders and women's representatives at various locations. A survey using a questionnaire showed strong support for the project and a willingness to accept land compensation under legal terms. The villagers were well-informed about the policies regarding compensation and the procedures for filing complaints. Throughout the construction process, regular consultations with local communities and other related stakeholders will be undertaken and documented in accordance with the project's SEP. The project's E&S documents are accessible both online and through hard copies in the project area. A semi-annual project progress report will be prepared by the PMO and shared with the Bank for review. The Bank will retain the rights to conduct filed visit and supervision during the Project’s implementation.12. Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).A multi-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been established to handle complaints related to the project. The PMO is responsible for managing the overall grievance process and coordinating with government departments. The PIU will handle daily complaints and provide feedback in a timely manner. Training programs will enhance skills and knowledge of GRM personnel. Information about the GRM has been shared through local public consultations. A separate GRM will handle workplace complaints. The information of the project-specific GRM and the Project-affected People's Mechanism (PPM) both in Chinese and English have been disclosed to the affected communities in an appropriate manner.",USD300 million,Category A,OK

The Project is expected to be operational in January 2027.","The Project site is located in the Angor district of the Surkhandarya region of the Republic of Uzbekistan, on the northeastern coast of the Uchkizil reservoir, which is an off-stream reservoir type used for irrigation.Applicable Policy and Standards.The AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including Environmental and Social Standard 1 (ESS1) on Environmental and Social Assessment and Management, and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) is applicable to this Project. In accordance with AIIB’s ESP, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) have been prepared. A comprehensive environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) has also been conducted. Based on the ESDD, an Environment and Social Action Plan (ESAP) has been prepared. The 9km 220/500kV overhead transmission lines to be built by JSC National Electric Grid (NEGU) to connect the Project power substation to the existing national grid are identified as Associated Facilities (AFs) to this Project. The environmental and social impacts of the AFs are discussed in the ESIA and the mitigations are recommended to NEGU as the Borrower has no control or influence over the AFs.Environmental and Climate Change.During the construction phase, the Project will result in certain negative impacts locally, including air pollution, noise and vibration resulting from heavy machinery and vehicles, soil erosion, discharge of wastewater and disposal of construction wastes. Mitigation measures are included in the ESMP. During operation, the Project will use a closed-loop cooling system with water supplied from the Uchkizil reservoir. The local authority has confirmed the water use by the CCGT will not affect other water users, like agricultural irrigation. A wastewater treatment system will be established within the Project and treated water will be discharged into Uchkizil reservoir in compliance with the standards of Uzbekistan. Thus, the impacts on surface water quality would be negligible. The noise and air quality assessments show compliance with applicable standards, including the National and international standards.According to the requirement of the local environmental authority, a Water Protection Zone (WPZ) has been assigned with a width of 150 meters from the water’s edge of Uchkizil reservoir. The only activities within the WPZ will be construction for water intake and wastewater pipelines, which is compliant with the WPZ requirements. The EPC contractor is required to obtain relevant permits in accordance with the national regulations.No Key Biodiversity Area including International Bird Areas are in the area of impact of the project. Based on terrestrial and aquatic surveys and the Critical Habitat Assessment, it was concluded that the Project site is not a critical habitat of any of the threatened species. A comprehensive assessment was conducted for the sensitive ecological receptors and mitigation measures are included in the ESIA for various phases of the Project. A Biodiversity Management Plan will be prepared by the contractor prior to site clearance. The water intake velocity will be limited within 0.15 m/s and a bubble curtain shall be applied to prevent fish and fauna to enter the intake. This Project is not expected to induce significant cumulative impacts.GHG emissions are estimated at 4,874 ktCO2eq (scope 1 and 2) in 2027, first year of operations of the Project. A Climate Change Risk Assessment was carried out as per the Equator Principle IV. The physical risks are ranked as moderate. A number of measures have been incorporated into the Project design and included in operational plans to address the findings of the assessment, including a dry cooler system for condensers minimizing process water consumption.Social Aspects.The land provided for the Project is from Surkhandarya regional reserve and is not currently under possession by any individual or legal entity. According to the decision by the regional administration, dated 30 August 2021, the Project area of 73 ha was allocated for the construction of a CCGT power plant. The decision was disclosed through the unified portal of theMinistry of Justice. During social surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022, no legal and/or informal land users were observed. There is no agricultural or other economic activity observed within the Project area. Consequently, the Project would not require any new land acquisition or any involuntary resettlement. Although there are no livelihood activities present in the Uchkizil reservoir, the water from the reservoir is used for the irrigation of crops and to supply water for fish breeding pools located in nearby villages. Therefore, the Project will monitor the quantity of water withdrawn from the Uchkizil reservoir and the quality of blowdown water discharged into the reservoir to manage and/or mitigate any potential risks to fishing, irrigated farming, and other water users from this reservoir. The results of the water monitoring will be regularly shared with relevant authorities and other interested stakeholders through the activities under the SEP. The Livelihood Restoration Framework prepared as part of ESIA covers water-related livelihood impacts, as well, and the project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be disclosed to broader communities that might have concerns or interests related to the project.Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure.Consultations with project-affected people and communities, government agencies and other stakeholders have been carried out during the preparation of the ESIA. Focus group discussions with households including women from local communities were held. Additional consultations have also been held after disclosure of the draft ESIA and ESMP, as detailed in the SEP to enable meaningful consultation and inclusive participation. The ESIA including the ESMP has been finalized according to the consultations. Hard copies of the ES documents will be made available at the Project site. The ESIA in English and Uzbek languages and the Non-Technical Summary and SEP in English, Russian and Uzbek languages are disclosed at the websites ofSCEandAIIB.Grievance Redress Mechanism.A detailed GRM is provided for in the ESIA. The project will establish two separate GRMs, one for internal parties, i.e., construction and commissioning personnel, contracted workers, and project staff (including subcontractors); and the other for external parties, i.e., PAP. The Project will publish information on GRMs at the plant-level for related stakeholders and PAP including local communities in accordance with the prepared ESIA. The information on the plant-level GRM and AIIB’s independent accountability mechanism, i.e. the Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) in the local language will be disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner. Access to the GRMs and Independent Accountability Mechanism will be free of cost. The relevant EPC Contractor will also be required to establish its GRM, and the contacts to access this GRM will be disclosed in local language in a timely and appropriate manner.

It is co-financed by IFC. To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the Project team proposes IFC’s Performance Standards (IFC PS) to be applicable for this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This is a Category B project according to IFC's Policy on Environment and Social (E&S) Sustainability (2012) and is expected to have limited adverse E&S impacts that are few, largely reversible and readily addressed through existing mitigation measures and good international industry practices (GIIP).The potential environmental risks (i) at construction phase includes disposal of construction materials, contamination to marine bodies and others, (ii) at operations phase includes discharge of ballast water with alien organisms, biofouling, air emissions pollutants (e.g., NOx, SOx, PM, etc.), accidents and spillage, and others. At the end of the ship’s lifespan, due consideration has to be taken for ship recycling where the scraps may contain environmentally hazardous substances such as heavy metals, ozone-depleting substances and others.Adverse social impacts are expected to be minimal since the activities financed using the Bank’s proceeds are only to purchase three new-build container ships for deployment. Based on information received from XPF, the proposed Project will have limited social risks that are largely reversible and readily addressed through existing mitigation measures and GIIP. Key potential social risks and issues associated with this project include the adequacy of corporate ESMS as applied to project vessels; working and living conditions and OHS for employees and contractors; security and compliance with the international ship and port security code; crew community interactions during shore leave; company stakeholder engagement and grievance redress.IFC’s appraisal supported by AIIB considered the environmental and social management planning process and documentation for the Project and gaps, if any, between these and IFC’s requirements. Where necessary, the agreed corrective measures, intended to close these gaps within a reasonable period of time, are summarized in a separate Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP). Through the implementation of these measures, the Project is expected to be designed and operated in accordance with Performance Standards objectives.XPF’sandEastaway’sEnvironmental and Social Management System (ESMS) with the upgrades mentioned in the ESAP will commensurate with the scale and E&S risks and impacts of the Project Companies.IFC has disclosed theE&S Review Summaryfor the Project on its website.

Application of ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples), though not anticipated, will be confirmed during project preparation.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), a Land Use Due Diligence Report (LUDDR) are under preparation covering both Component 1 and 2 consistent with AIIB’s ESP while a separate ESIA, a Resettlement Plan (RP)/LUDDR will be prepared for Component 3. In addition, a project-specific Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) will be prepared to set out the strategy and program regarding stakeholder engagement activities during the project preparation and implementation. The ESIA including the ESMP, SEP, LUDDRs/ RP in English and Chinese languages will be disclosed in an appropriate manner to PAPs and identified stakeholders and made available for download at the Client’s website and AIIB website. In addition, detail arrangement of ES monitoring and reporting on the implementation of ESMP will be discussed and determined with the client during the appraisal stage.Environmental and Climate Change Aspects.Most environmental impacts during the construction phase will be temporary and reversible including contamination of surface water due to small scale of dredging, pier works and wastewater discharge, noise, wastes including dredged materials, construction debris and other solid wastes, soil erosion and dust and emissions from construction vehicles and equipment. The ESIAs will also evaluate the biodiversity impacts of the terminals. Air emissions from vessels will be among the key environmental impacts during the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the terminals. The ESIA will also include a Risk Assessment of pier operation especially for oil spill accident. It will also evaluate the impacts and risks to community health and safety. Other potential adverse impacts during O&M phase will include wastewater and wastes generated from ships and the pier area, noise and traffic congestion. The integration of Green Port Concept into the design will be able to mitigate those impacts. The project is assessed as being exposed to a high climate risk, particularly to precipitation increase, flood and wind speed increase. A Climate Change Risk Assessment will be carried out and adaptation measures will be recommended to the design.Social aspects.Key social risks associated with the project are related to land acquisition.  It is estimated by the Design Institute that Daorenji Terminal, Sonyanghu Terminal and Songmu Terminal will use around 185mu[1], 376mu, and 150 mu of land respectively. The parcels of land belong either to the state or to the village collective. Most of land was acquired in line with national regulations in 2015 or 2018, which will be reviewed, or due diligence activated for any outstanding legacy issues during the appraisal. If additional land requirement is needed for the components, land acquisition and resettlement impacts will be evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures to restore and/or improve the livelihoods of Project-affected people (PAP) will be proposed. An Entitlement Matrix will be prepared and an approximate budget and schedule for Resettlement and Rehabilitation will be worked out. An RP will be disclosed and consulted with PAPs prior to its implementation.Gender.The potential impact of the Project activities on women in the community will be analyzed and reflected accordingly in the Environmental and Social documents including the identification of measures to prevent and/or address potential negative impacts caused by the labour influx on the community including gender-based violence (GBV), sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), sexual harassment (SH) risks. The assessment will also use gender disaggregated data and analysis and consider enhancing the design of the Project to promote equality of opportunity and women’s socioeconomic empowerment, particularly with respect to provision of services and employment.Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).The Project will require two separate GRMs to be implemented, one for internal parties, i.e., construction and commissioning personnel, workers, project staff (including sub-contractors’ staff and visitors); and the other for external parties- project-affected people (PAP), making anonymous complaints eligible. All relevant complaints from PAPs will be accepted by the GRMs including those in relation to GBV/SEA/SH, conflicts between project employees and community members.

Application of ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples), though not anticipated, will be confirmed during project preparation. The Project is assigned Category A as the Environmental and Social (E&S) impacts of the project may be substantial due to significant noise, vibration and potential biodiversity impact, land acquisition, potential physical displacements and resettlement, and disturbance to communities.An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report and a Social Stability Risk Assessment chapter under Feasibility Study Report (FSR) have been prepared by the Project Implementation Entities (PIEs) for Component 1 and Component 3 respectively, while for Component 2 they will be prepared according to domestic regulations. The PIEs have agreed to update the EIAs into Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) including Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), to be consistent with AIIB’s ESP. A Resettlement Plan (RP) for Component 1 and 2 respectively, as well as a Stakeholders Engagement Plan (SEP) for the overall project, will be prepared.Environmental and Climate Aspects.Most of the adverse environmental impacts during the construction phase are localized, including noise and vibration, dust and air emissions, water contamination, solid wastes, soil erosion, and material source consumption. Special attention will be paid to vibration impacts of tunneling on sensitive receptors including the cultural heritage. The potential risks to community health and safety and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) will also be assessed in the ESIA. During the operational phase, the main impacts of the Project will include noise and vibration of the railway. The incremental and cumulative noise and vibration impacts will be assessed against applicable standards considering Chinese standards, Zhejiang provincial regulations on railway noise and those in World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines.Although there are two Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) and two Alliance of Zero Extinction (AZE) sites in the radius of 50km of the Project, they are more than 10km away from the Project sites and unlikely to be inside the area of impacts of the components. The due diligence and ESIA will further evaluate if the KBA and AZE sites would be affected.The Project is Paris Agreement (PA) aligned on Mitigation side, given rail and port projects are considered universally aligned with PA’s Mitigation Goals. The Project will have significant GHG emission reduction benefits, particularly from Component 1 and 2 as trucks are replaced by rail. A Climate Risk and Adaptation Assessment will be carried out and appropriate adaptation measures will be integrated in the design.Social Aspects.The Project is estimated to involve significant land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts as identified in the Feasibility Study Report (FSR) of Component 1. The scope of Component 2 is not entirely fixed, it is estimated by local design institution that there may also have significant LAR impacts when conducting alignment optimization during FSR preparation. However, this will be clarified once the data become available. As for Component 3, it is now located within Beilun, and consists of equipment purchase and existing terminal upgrades. No LAR impact for this Component. An RP will be prepared to govern any physical and economic displacement of a temporary or permanent nature for Component 1 and Component 2. An Entitlement Matrix will be prepared and an approximate budget and schedule for Resettlement and Rehabilitation will be worked out. Due diligence will be conducted and documented for the associated facilities and existing facilities in the project.Noise/Vibration Induced Displacement.It is stipulated by Zhejiang provincial regulation that environmentally sensitive buildings outside the Right of Way of the railway but within 30 meters from the middle line of the outer rail shall be acquired and compensated, concerning about noise or vibration impacts. If displacement is inevitable, the impacts on Project-Affected People (PAP) are to be discussed in the RP or Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) if noise impact could not be determined during the project preparation phase. Comprehensive noise and vibration modeling and impact assessment with alternatives of mitigations will be carried out and included in the ESIA and ESMP.Gender Aspects.The potential impact of project activities on women in the community will be assessed in the ESIA. A Gender Action Plan will be prepared to mitigate the adverse impacts and promote inclusion/equality for benefit-sharing for the female. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, including Client and community members, measures will be identified to prevent potential negative impacts caused by the influx of migrant workers in the community and the risk of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment, and will be included in the management plans.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, Monitoring and Information Disclosure. Meaningful and inclusive stakeholder engagement with affected communities and other stakeholders will be carried out during the preparation of the environmental and social (E&S) documents.

These have become the limiting factors to the Beihai Municipality and Guangxi for further economic development, particularly to the government’s ambition towards an upgraded ocean economic development.Component 1 – Near-shore marine pollution management and environmental improvement (Cost USD272 million).This component will support interventions to manage the pollution of the Lianzhou Bay in an integrated manner – from source to sea. Two major activities to be financed in this component are: (i) clean-up of the polluted sediments of the Bay area through dredging and disposal; (ii) management of the source of pollution from the land side through upgrading the urban stormwater and sewerage systems, interception and treatment of polluted discharges.Component 2 – Mangrove rehabilitation and afforestation (Cost USD50 million).This component will consist of two types of activities: (i) rehabilitation and protection of the degraded mangrove habitats; and (ii) restoration and plantation of new mangroves to rebuild the mangrove forest. These interventions will recover the degraded marine wetlands and ecosystems, improve biodiversity and ecological services, protect the coastal areas from natural hazards, and establish a “blue carbon” storage for climate resilience.Component 3 – Integrated coastline management (Cost USD153 million).This component will finance (i) restoration and stabilization of coastline interfacing the Lianzhou Bay and the urban districts of Beihai; (ii) construction and upgrading of sea dikes. The first sub-component is to restore the degraded coastline through beach nourishment, restoration of coastal wetlands, landscaping, and improvement of wastewater management network along the coast to reduce pollution to the Bay system through interception of stormwater and wastewater discharges. The dikes will use both the traditional engineering method and nature-based solutions, including restoration and conservation of floodplains, salt marshes and mangroves.Component 4 – Smart monitoring and early warning systems (Cost USD8 million).This component will develop an online monitoring system for mangrove development and protection, and an early warning system to prevent costal disasters and support emergency response. Digital technologies, including sensor-based, web-based and Global Positioning System (GPS)-based information collection and transfer, Geographical Information System (GIS)-based modeling, will be applied for real-time monitoring and forecasting to support decision making in emergency and disaster management.Component 5 – Capacity building, knowledge dissemination and project management support (Cost USD8 million).This component focuses on capacity building and knowledge sharing in the following areas: (i) the Project related studies on a) mangrove blue carbon sequestration and biodiversity, b) benefits of NBS for climate resilience and the Project sustainability; (ii) methodology and capacity development, based on the study results, to monitor and evaluate the project achievements and impact; (iii) knowledge dissemination through awareness raising, designed trainings, organized events nationally and internationally; and (iv) project management support to build up the capacity of the project management office and project implementation unit for project implementation.","Environmental and Social Policy.The Project is being prepared consistent with the AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement), and Environmental and Social Exclusion List. Application of ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples), though not anticipated, will be confirmed during the Project preparation.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), and a Resettlement Plan (RP), consistent with AIIB’s ESP, will be prepared by the project implementation unit (PIU). The environmental and social (E&S) documents in English and Chinese languages will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner to Project-Affected People (PAPs) and identified stakeholders and made available for download at the government website and AIIB website.Environmental and Climate Aspects.The Project will potentially contribute to carbon sequestration and improvement of ecosystem services through mangrove rehabilitation and afforestation, wetland conservation and/or restoration through integrated coastline management, and pollution control in the bay area through point source management. The major adverse impacts of the Project during construction may include loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, sea water contamination due to dredging, and secondary pollution from dredging sludge if the final disposal were not well selected and managed. A Biodiversity Study will be carried out to establish the baseline in the Project area, to assess the adverse impacts and to prepare a Biodiversity Management Plan. Other expected impacts, generally localized, will include dust and emissions from construction vehicles, construction noise, disturbance to the traffic, soil erosion, and wastewater and solid wastes generated during construction. The mitigations for addressing the adverse impacts will be included in the ESIA and ESMP. The potential risks to community health and safety and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) will also be assessed in the ESIA.The Project region could face increased risks of climate hazards like increased intensity of precipitation, coastal flooding, typhoon and storm surges, and sea level rise due to climate change. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting will be carried out and GHG reductions will be calculated. A Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) will also be conducted and the opportunities for climate adaptation will be identified.Social Aspects.The Project will contribute to the social upliftment of the people of Beihai by the restoration of the marine ecosystem of the Lianzhou Bay area. Meanwhile, the preliminary social screening indicates that significant amount of various types of land will be affected and will involve resettlements. Site visits confirmed that the infrastructure development activities will have either physical and/or economic displacement with the upgrading of sea dikes having the most impact on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. A Resettlement Plan including an entitlement matrix will be prepared. An approximate budget and implementation schedule for resettlement and rehabilitation will be worked out in compliance with AIIB’s ESP.Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).

Furthermore, more frequent and severe occurrences of waterlogging, flood and drought, and loss of biodiversity and natural resources are expected to be exacerbated by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events brought by climate change.To achieve the project development objective, the following project components are being considered by the Ulanhot Municipality:Component 1 – Climate Resilient Urban Infrastructure Improvement. This component will support the improvement of key public infrastructure such as road network and accompanying pedestrian and non-motorized transport pathways as well as the underground drainage system, water supply and sanitation as well as heating pipeline in selected low-income communities. Integration between engineering design with nature-based solutions will be the main design feature of the improvement. Rainwater harvesting and storage systems will also be integrated in the design, aiming to store and utilize 80% of rainwater and recharge groundwater to enhance local ecological system. It will also support the greening and building resilience of community public space such as plaza/square, parks and children’s parks.Component 2 – Ecological Enhancement of Tao’er River and Wetland This component aims to restore riparian area along the Tao’er River and wetland. The activities will further enhance ecological and biodiversity conservation as well as increase the natural water storage capacity of the basin to reduce flood and waterlogging risk which could be exacerbated by climate change. This component will also support the ecological treatment of abandoned quarries and factories, to reduce pollution and soil erosion as well as safety risk.Component 3 – City Climate Smart Management and Capacity Building. The component will support the adoption of digital technology such as Geographic Information System (GIS) and big data analysis to assist in managing water resources, underground equipment and pipelines, flood and drought prevention and mitigation measures, weather emergency system, and smart water supply system. Collecting accurate, reliable, and up to date data from various sources are also part of the system design to ensure robust results.","The Bank’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List will apply to this Project.

No Net Loss is required and can be implemented through a combination of mitigation measures including pre-construction translocation, adapted fencing, and offset of lost habitat through the restoration of the available modified habitat within the PV site. The Khaudag Ridge area at the eastern end of the Sherabad OHL has also been classified as Critical Habitat for Tajikistan Toadhead Agama. While permanent impacts will be limited to areas affected by tower footings, an NG of the species will be likely achieved through habitat restoration in this area.All three PV plants are not located on any major bottleneck or geographical feature that would concentrate migrating bird species and does not contain features that would attract migrating or over-wintering birds. Several species of birds have been assessed as PBFs and operational phase collision risk can be mitigated by the installation of bird diverters along the entire length of the OHLs. The site and OHL for Jizzakh and Samarkand are located in proximity to important wintering habitat for Great Bustards (International Union for Conservation of Nature, Vulnerable) during cold winters. While bird diverters are not fully effective for the Great Bustards which remains susceptible to collision risk, offset measures focusing on a reduction of poaching (currently identified as the biggest threat to this species) will be developed and implemented to facilitate an NG. A draft Biodiversity Action Plan is prepared to elaborate on the offset strategies and monitoring of mitigation and offset measures proposed in the ESIA.Social aspects.The proposed three PV plants have permanent and temporary land impacts. None of the three PV plants will require physical displacement, however, there are economic displacement impacts within the solar PV sites in Samarkand and Jizzakh and under the proposed OHLs. In Sherabad, no livelihood impacts are anticipated at the PV site since the area provides a relatively low-quality grazing area for livestock from three adjacent communities, with alternative areas available and includes only two leaseholders who did not use the land. Significant livelihood impacts are not anticipated at the PV site in Jizzakh. One community herder access grazing area by crossing the site who will need to use longer alternative routes. Whereas in the case of Samarkand, livelihood impacts are anticipated at the PV site, since the area was recently used by 5 leaseholders where leases were terminated for Project purposes prior to the involvement of the Sponsor. An audit of the historical land acquisition has identified gaps against Lenders’ standards which will be addressed in the form of additional compensation for affected agricultural assets and provision of livelihood restoration measures including a specific land enhancement grant and technical assistance to improve the capacity of leaseholders remaining land. The site also provides relatively high-quality grazing and is used by five community herds and as a supply of vegetation used for winter livestock feed. Livelihood restoration measures proposed include securing and enhancing alternative community grazing land, maintaining access to the project site to continue feed collection and development of feed storage facilities as well as specific measures for affected herders. The final route and tower location for the OHLs have been selected in consultation with leaseholders to avoid structures and higher value crops where possible. Compensation for temporary and permanent impacts to 56 households in Sherabad, 7 leaseholders in Jizzakh and 4 leaseholders in Samarkand along the OHLs will also be provided. To mitigate the economic displacement impacts, a draft LRP for each PV plant has been developed and disclosed by the Borrower.Labor and Working Conditions.The Project will be co-financed with EBRD and AIIB will follow the same approach as that adopted by the EBRD in addressing potential issues regarding labor and working conditions. Enhanced supply chain due diligence has been conducted for the solar components. The Sponsor has provided evidence of a functioning supply chain management system including a number of policies and position statements stating that the Sponsor has a zero tolerance to labor violations. The supply chain for this particular Project, to polysilicon, has been mapped and will be verified by an independent consultant for point of origin. The Financing Agreement and ESAP require the Sponsor and the Borrower to maintain due diligence and management procedures for the sourcing of solar modules in accordance with Good International Practice.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.The draft ESIAs and associated documentation, including Non-Technical Summary (NTS), SEPs and LRPs in English and Uzbek were disclosed in December 2022 by the Borrower for Samarkand , Jizzakh and Sherabad PV plants on its website. Those documents have been disclosed locally for a public consultation with consultation activities to be undertaken as outlined in the SEP. AIIB will disclose prepared ES documents for the Project in English and Uzbek in an appropriate manner. The Borrower is required to develop and subsequently disclose a BAP to elaborate on the offset strategies and monitoring measures, based on further consultation with recognized stakeholders in avian conservation, to demonstrate NNL/NG for CH and PBFs. In addition, the Project will be monitored regularly by independent Environmental and Social consultants for compliance with the ESAP and the Performance Requirements, and the monitoring reports for three PV plants will be prepared and submitted to the lenders including AIIB for review.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.The Borrower will disseminate the information of Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs) at the project level for related stakeholders including local communities in accordance with EBRD’s PR10 (Information Disclosure and Stakeholder Engagement) requirements. The information on project-level GRMs and EBRD’s independent accountability mechanism in Uzbek at least will be disclosed timely in an appropriate manner. The EBRD’s independent accountability mechanism (IAM) will provide avenues for complaints to file any concerns regarding the Project if the GRM at the project level for each one of three PV plants is not functional or irresponsive. Access to the mechanism including project-level GRMs and the IAM will be free of cost. The relevant EPC Contractor will also be required to establish its GRM, and the contacts to access this GRM will be disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner.",,Category B,OK

Environmental and Social due diligence (ESDD) determined that ESS 1 (E&S assessment and management) applies to the assessment of ES impacts of project activities. ESS 2 (involuntary resettlement) also applies, as project related activities will require significant land acquisition which in turn will cause physical and economic displacement. The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) carried out as part of the ESDD indicates that there are no Scheduled Tribes in the project districts and within the administrative boundary of the State of Haryana. Therefore, ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. Though majority of the project alignment will align with the existing KMP Expressway corridor, the project has been classified as category A, in accordance with the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), and consistent with the Part A of the HORC project.  This is due to the social risks and impacts stemming from the displacement of a significant number of project-affected people.The main environmental risks anticipated include (i) noise and vibration impacts to receptors along the alignments during both construction and operation stages; (ii) construction phase impacts such as solid waste disposal, increased water use, air pollution, impacts on borrow areas, occupational and community health and safety, and disturbance to communities and public utilities; and (iii) potential biodiversity impacts. The potential adverse social impacts are related to land acquisition which include loss of land, loss of structures (residential, and commercial) and loss of trees and crops and community and religious properties. Land acquisition for HORC will have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable households and lead to loss of jobs and business incomes. The nature of the civil works is also anticipated to induce short-term impacts linked to temporary loss of access, risk of child labor, labor influx, disruptions to commercial activities and adverse effects on public utilities.To mitigate these risks, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) have been carried out covering both Parts A and B of the proposed HORC investment program. No impacts have been identified on biodiversity resources in the project corridor. An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a Resettlement Plan (RP) inclusive of a Livelihood Restoration Plan and future stakeholder engagement plan were prepared. The ESIA includingESMPandRP, both in English and Hindi, were disclosed on March 25, 2022. Executive Summaries of these documents in Hindi have also beendisclosed from AIIB’s website. Hard copies of the reports will be kept in HRIDC Offices and site offices, concerned District Collector’s Office for public information and disclosure.A project-specific Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been established to receive, acknowledge, evaluate and facilitate the resolution to the complaints relating to ES issues with corrective actions proposed.  This was established using understandable and transparent processes that are gender responsive, culturally appropriate, and readily accessible to all segments of the project-affected people (PAPs) and the project contracted workers. The GRM will be expanded to include a Contractor level GRM to facilitate management of issues raised by workers. Records of grievances received, corrective actions taken, and their outcomes shall be properly maintained.

Summary of ESMS both in English and Chinese will be disclosed timely by Chongho Bridge and AIIB in an appropriate manner.Environmental Characteristics. Rooftop solar installation provides a valuable source of renewable energy in rural areas that helps to avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to China’s overall decarbonization journey. The Project’s potential environmental impacts include health and safety on the construction of the physical works, electronic waste generated from operational maintenance of the solar PVs. Labor and working conditions in supply chains management will be incorporated in Chongho Bridge’s ESMS. Chongho Bridge has prepared Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for Liao II Project and Tianjin Project, which has been disclosed on Chongho Bridge’s official website in both English (link) and Chinese (link), and also disclosed on AIIB’s official website in both English (link) and Chinese (link).SocialCharacteristics.Chongho Bridge’s rooftop solar business follows the rooftop rental (developer-owned) model, where Chongho Bridge is responsible for developing and maintaining the solar facilities, and rural households rent their rooftops to Chongho Bridge. This approach avoids the land acquisition risk for the proposed Project and will bring social benefits to the rural community. With Chongho Bridge responsible for developing, operating, and maintaining the rooftop solar power stations, rural households can enjoy long-term rental income and livelihood improvement.Climate Change and Paris Alignment. Solar power generation has significantly lower lifecycle emissions than fossil fuel-based power generation, the Project is aligned with the mitigation goals of Paris Agreement. Climate physical risk of the Project has been considered during the feasibility study stage, ESIA process, and climate resilience feature has been incorporated in the design of the Project. All solar PVs installed are subject to quality test against certain extreme climate conditions such as heavy snow, and wind pressure. All SPV facilities are insured for any loss caused by climate and other natural hazard. The Project is considered aligned with the adaptation and resilience goals of Paris Agreement.Gender. Chongho Bridge has been promoting gender leadership internally. The solar business unit is led by a woman CEO and aims to maintain a management team with at least 50% of woman. Women of the rural households participating the Project activities will be fully consulted to ensure they are aware of the Project’s benefits to their households. Chongho Bridge will also promote woman participation in the Project’s operating and maintenance activities through a gender inclusive training program. To prevent any gender-based violence during project construction, the Company included Code of Conduct for Contractor’s Workers in the bidding documents, with an emphasis on zero tolerance of gender-based violence.Labor and Working Conditions.The ESMS includes requirements to identify and mitigate potential health, safety, social and environmental hazards in all project activities that pose a risk to employees and may also have the potential for disruption of site works. In addition, all suppliers and contractors will be advised of the importance of implementing appropriate management measures to identify and address issues related to the environmental and social provisions of the ESMS for the Project, including labor and working conditions and health and safety matters. Compliance with the ESMS is an essential part of the contract document with suppliers and contractors. This compliance as well as representations and warranties to be provided to Chongho Bridge by suppliers and contractors will be reflected in relevant agreements and contracts.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure. Chongho Bridge has developed corporate level stakeholder engagement plan for solar business benchmarking AIIB ESS. Different stakeholders have been fully consulted for Liaoning II Project and Tianjin Project to be supported by Tranche 1 of the AIIB loan. The owners of the residential buildings were engaged on the details of the solar PV installation and their consent via the rooftop lease agreement. The ESIA and ESMP of the Liaoning II Project and Tianjin Project have been disclosed on Chongho Bridge’s corporate website in both Chinese and English, 30 calendar days in advance of AIIB’s financing approval.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.During Project implementation, AIIB will require submission of relevant E&S documentation and E&S performance monitoring reports from Chongho Bridge in an agreed format.

E&S due diligence (ESDD) determined that ESS 1 (E&S assessment and management) applies to the assessment of E&S impacts of project activities. ESS 2 (involuntary resettlement) also applies, as project related activities will require significant land acquisition which in turn will cause physical and economic displacement. The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) carried out as part of the ESDD indicates that there are no Scheduled Tribes in the project districts and within the administrative boundary of the State of Haryana. Therefore, ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. Though majority of the project alignment will align with the existing KMP Expressway corridor, the project has also been classified as category A, in accordance with the Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), because of the social risks and impacts stemming from the displacement of a significant number of project-affected people.The main environmental risks anticipated include (i) noise and vibration impacts to receptors along the alignments during both construction and operation stages; (ii) construction phase impacts such as solid waste disposal, increased water use, air pollution, impacts on borrow areas, occupational and community health and safety, and disturbance to communities and public utilities; and (iii) potential biodiversity impacts. The potential adverse social impacts related to land acquisition include loss of land, loss of structures (residential, and commercial) and loss of trees and crops and community and religious properties. Land acquisition for HORC is likely to have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable households and lead to loss of jobs and business income. The nature of the civil works is also anticipated to induce short-term impacts linked to temporary loss of access, risk of child labor, labor influx, disruptions to commercial activities and adverse effects on public utilities.To mitigate these risks, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) have been carried out covering both Part A and B of the proposed HORC investment program. No impacts have been identified on biodiversity resources in the project corridor. An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a Resettlement Plan (RP) inclusive of a Livelihood Restoration Plan and future stakeholder engagement plan were prepared. The ESIA includingESMPandRP, in English, were disclosed on March 25, 2022. Executive Summaries of these documents have also beendisclosed.

The Operation will help the Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) establish robust legal frameworks for privatization, competition, and insolvency, increase private sector participation, deepen non-bank financial markets, reduce fiscal risks, and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the social protection system that was greatly expanded as part of COVID-19 response measures.","This Loan will be co-financed with the WB as lead co-financier, and its environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the WB’s Development Policy Financing (DPF) Policy. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to DPF operations. Therefore, as permitted by the decision of AIIB’s Board of Directors set forth in the Decisions to Support the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility, the WB’s DPF Policy will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the environmental and social risks and impacts of the Operation.In accordance with the DPF Policy, the WB has reviewed the measures under the Operation to determine whether they are likely to have significant negative social impacts or result in increased poverty (especially for the poor and vulnerable groups) or to cause significant negative effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources.Over the longer-term, all actions in the operation are likely to generate positive distributional benefits through greater private sector growth and job creation, and from the reduced cost of inefficient public spending. The poverty and social analysis conducted by WB indicate that actions supported by the Program are expected to improve private sector growth, SOE management and increase social inclusion and resilience. Of the nine proposed prior actions, six have clear, significant, and direct poverty and/or distributional implications. Three of the six are expected to have strong positive or distributional impacts. These include measures to increase competition, strengthen the social protection system and improve the maternity benefit system. In the absence of mitigation measures, two actions could potentially carry short-term risks of increased poverty and/or entail negative social effects. These relate to two privatization-related market reforms. The remaining actions on non-bank financing and SOE reforms are likely to be broadly neutral in their impact. Where negative effects have been identified they are not irreversible, and mitigation measures through the social protection system and the use of other regulatory safeguards would moderate possible poverty and social impacts relating to these actions. These are reinforced by the continued focus of the World Bank’s DPO engagements on improving the social safety net system in Uzbekistan, including through measures proposed under this operation.The Operation addresses gender inclusion by enabling women’s effective economic participation. Prior action under the Increasing inclusion pillar aims to eliminate discouraging provisions for the employment of women by the private sector. To reduce hiring discrimination barriers against women in the private sector, the Borrower has abrogated the requirement that private sector employers to pay maternity benefits and has instead required such benefits to be paid from public funds.One action in this proposed Operation has potentially negative environmental impacts that requires close monitoring. Based on the application of the provisions of the World Bank Toolkit, the prior action supporting the privatization law will need consideration of responsibilities with regard to pollution management legacies to avoid longer-term adverse environmental impacts.",,,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable while ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable as no Indigenous Peoples were identified within the project area of influence during the due diligence process. The Project is assigned Category A with a “high” environmental and social risk rating, in accordance with the ESP due to land acquisition and large-scale construction activities and related long-term and irreversible environmental and social impacts.An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) with an associated Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) have been prepared by the client in accordance with AIIB ESP (2019). The widening and strengthening of the existing 1.5km-long village road between Battala Bazar and the Plant Gate is considered an Associated Facility (AF) as the village road will also be used as access road for the Project. The widening of the existing village road is being conducted by the Local Government Engineering Department. Thus, UMPL has neither control over nor influence on the AF. However, the environmental and social impacts due to the road widening are assessed in the ESIA.An independent E&S Due Diligence (ESDD) was conducted including an ES Audit of the ongoing construction works. The Audit generated a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) which has been implemented since February 2021.Environmental Aspects.Comprehensive environmental and ecological assessment including a Critical Habitat Assessment was carried out as part of ESIA. The assessment revealed that with mitigation measures under the ESMP and the CAP, the impacts of the Project on aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity would be insignificant or mitigated. UMPL will also promote local fish breeding site for fish resource conservation in consultation with the Fishery Department and fisherman.The Project will generate various adverse environmental impacts during construction phases including soil erosion and contamination, water use and pollution, wastes, air emissions, noise, loss of flora and fauna, occupational health and safety (OHS) risks, disturbance to local traffic, irrigation canal and pumps and risks to community health and safety due to influx of labor. According to the ESIA and ESMP, with mitigation measures none of the environmental impacts would be significant during the operation of the plant. In particular, the Project would not degrade the ambient air quality in terms of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matters. Thanks to the induced-draft cooling system and wastewater treatment system in the Plant, the impacts of this Project on water resources and surface water quality of the Meghna River are minimal. According to the noise modeling assessment, the noise level at the sensitive receptors (a mosque and a school) could meet the applicable standards in daytime with mitigations but not at night-time because the baseline noise level (without the Project) at night-time is already close to the standards. Considering there would be few activities during night-time in the mosque and the school, the impact is considered minor. The Client will carry out noise monitoring and assessment after the commissioning and select the optimal mitigations to form a Noise Prevention and Control Plan for Operation if needed.A Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) was also conducted, and the results showed the cumulative impacts on water resource, water quality and ambient air quality are negligible.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.Bangladesh will be facing a higher degree of uncertainty in rainfall and a likelihood of an increase in intensity for extreme rainfall events due to climate change. A Climate Change Risk Assessment was carried out as per the Equator Principal IV. The physical risks were ranked as moderate. A number of measures have been incorporated into the project design and included in operational plans and processes to mitigate and control the risks identified. In particular, the design of the stormwater drain has been updated to adapt to the rainfall of 120 mm/hour to address the extremely heavy precipitation events and the flooding risks. For extreme weather risks, regular monitoring of weather forecasts as well as testing and trialing the emergency response plans will be key for increasing resilience of the infrastructure assets.Paris Agreement Alignment.Bangladesh is one of the lowest GHG emitters in the world, with a contribution of less than 0.35% of global emissions. As per the Country’s NDC, the government highlighted key mitigation actions, including the implementation of renewable energy, enhanced efficiency of existing power plants, and use of improved technology for power generation. Renewable energy presents a very small fraction of the current generation. Scarcity of land, high renewable energy tariffs, variability of renewable energy, weak institutional capacity, limited renewable energy resources potential, limited grid network capacity and the relatively high initial cost of setting up renewable energy plants are among the obstacles to implementing large-scale, on-grid renewable energy projects. As such, given the constraints, the government has taken initiatives to increase usage of gas in most efficient manner while continuing its efforts of exploring renewable energy in the country. In this project, 584MW CCGT will be equipped with GE 9HA.01 class gas turbine, which is one of the most efficient turbines globally and in the country (up to ~64% net efficiency). As per the Technical Working Group of the International Financial Institutions (IFI TWG), the combined grid emission factor in Bangladesh is 412 gCO2/kWh, while the estimated project emission factor is 335.66 gCO2/kWh, considering the plant is operational on gas at full load basis. Furthermore, this turbine’s combustion system offers fuel flexibility and is able to operate on both rich and lean gaseous fuels, including a 50% hydrogen (H2) capability with a technology pathway to 100% H2which would result in further GHG reduction. The Project is net positive in terms of overall CO2reduction over the life of the project and is aligned to the Paris Agreement.Social Aspects.The construction of the Project is at an advanced stage. Most of the land for the Project was acquired through Willing Buyer-Willing Seller (WS-WB) transactions between 2018-2020. Moreover, land required for the access road, considered an associated facility, was acquired through the eminent domain of the government. Additional land was also leased from businesses and local community members to establish setback areas.Project-related activities have led to adverse impacts on four primary categories, including (i)landowners/titleholders, (ii) the land-dependent but without title, (iii) fishers, and (iv) PAPs along the access road (title and non-titleholders). Land acquisition and civil works are also expected to have generated disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, including Women headed Households, the elderly, and Persons with disability.All titleholder PAPs whose land has been acquired through WS-WB transactions, have received compensation. In addition, a land Acquisition audit was conducted to assess the land acquisition process, compensation status, and associated consultations. Future stakeholder engagement and monitoring will follow up on any issues concerning the WS-WB transactions. The land Acquisition audit has also indicated that all compensation for titleholder PAPs for the land acquired through eminent domain for strengthening and expanding the access road has been completed. Moreover, to further mitigate the Project's adverse impacts and reduce vulnerability, a Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) has been developed by carrying out meaningful consultation with various categories of Project Affected people. Through the consultation process, the concerns and aspirations of PAPs have been captured and used to design mitigation measures. The LRP includes a detailed Entitlement Matrix that identifies the entitled unit and category of loss and links them with compensation and assistance measures.Moreover, vulnerable households are provided additional special assistance, such as financial support and training. Given the Project's adverse impacts on livelihoods, the Project carried out stakeholder engagement with the PAPs to identify livelihood improvement activities. Livelihood improvement activities to be carried out as part of this Project include (a) Financial Support during the transition period, (b) Assistance for the Fishing community, (c) Skill Training on Farm and Non-Farm Activities, (d) Improved agricultural equipment for enhanced agricultural productivity through the provision of higher-yielding seeds, (e) Technical training for Youth, (f) Within the context of the Project, explore Job Opportunities for the vulnerable PAPs. Moreover, LRP includes an institutional setup to deliver the LRP and consists of a detailed budget and monitoring parameters. A Gender Action Plan has also been prepared to mitigate the adverse impact on women.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, Monitoring, and Information Disclosure.A meaningful and culturally appropriate stakeholder engagement campaign was conducted during the ESIA process and preparation of other safeguard documents such as land audit and livelihood restoration plan. Stakeholder Engagement is not a one-off activity and that will be carried out through the project cycle with various categories of stakeholders.The stakeholders comprised of affected landowners, local community, Mosque committees, opinion leaders and government authorities. Stakeholders’ engagement was carried out using a variety of methods including public consultations, FGDs, key informant interviews and discussions with households. Moreover, specific FGDs were organized with women, fishers and river water users. A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been prepared as part of the ESIA, which sets out the strategy and plan regarding continuous engagement during the construction and O&M phases.The Bank’s ES Specialists will carry out field-based ES monitoring and supervision when conditions allow. Meanwhile, the environmental and social consultant hired by the Project will conduct site inspection and monitoring quarterly up to the Commercial Operations Date, semi-annually during the first two years after the Commercial Operations Date, and annually thereafter and report to AIIB and other lenders from time to time.The ESIA including ESMP and SEP and the LRP documents in English language, and LRP, Executive Summary of ESIA in English and Bengali languages are disclosed on the websites ofUMPLandAIIB. The hard copies of the documents are made available in the Project area. The Executive Summaries in Bengali languages are disseminated in an appropriate manner to PAPs and identified stakeholders. During the disclosure period, several additional FGDs and workshops were organized. The feedback received during the consultations has been incorporated into the ESIA.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.Two separate GRMs have been established and operational, one for internal parties, i.e., construction and commissioning personnel, workers, project staff (including sub-contractors’ staff); and the other for external parties, i.e., affected people, who can also make anonymous complaints. Complaints from PAPs have been accepted by the external GRM. Similar GRMs will be established for the operation phase. The GRM can also accept complaints in relation to gender-based violence, and conflicts between project employees and community members. The information of project-level GRM as well as AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) in Bengali language will be timely disclosed by UMPL to PAPs in an appropriate manner.",,Category A,OK

Given the nature and scope of the project activities, ADB has categorized the ES risks of the project as Category B for Environment, C for Involuntary Resettlement and C for Indigenous Peoples (which is equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applicable). The proposed Project will have (i) general environmental and social impacts and risks which are minor, localized, reversible and temporary in nature.These impacts can be effectively managed using practical and mature mitigation measures. These impacts come from the development of allied infrastructure such as depots and charging stations, and the operation of e-buses, including thee management of waste from used batteries. The Sponsor, GMPL, has an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). A corporate audit on GMPL’s ESMS and an environment and social compliance audit on GMPL’s past and current performance against the objectives, principles and requirements of ADB’s SPS (2009) have been carried out. A Corrective Action Plan (CAP) has been agreed to address issues identified during the audit.  The audit has confirmed that GMPL has an EHS unit with staff members with experience in preparing ES related documents following international environmental and social requirements.Social Aspects.Land requirements for depots would be leased by GEPL within existing bus depots. The land leased for the project and allied infrastructure will be from commercially owned land parcels. The land parcels requiring any physical and economic displacement will be eliminated during site screening. Hence, the project will not result in involuntary resettlement. The audit has also confirmed that the project does not have any legacy issues related to land, nor will it have any impact on indigenous people/scheduled tribes. The proposed Project is expected to generate largely positive social benefits to the overall population. As the civil works are minimal, and construction is to take place on existing bus depots, the construction period will remain short and, as a result, the impact, potential inconvenience on the surrounding residents' travel and local traffic is seen to be minimal.Gender Aspects.The potential impacts of Project activities – both positive and negative - on women in the community were screened. In consultation with relevant stakeholders, measures such as staff awareness on gender equality have been included in the company’s policy to promote improved employment opportunities for women. Key gender-based indicators proposed are as followed:3 bus depots completed, with women-friendly safety featuresAll bus drivers and cabin hosts trained on safety response protocols with specific attention to women passengers’ safetyNumber of jobs provided to women during operation phase increased to at least 500A women’s leadership program at GMPL implementedGMPL’s new internship program for technical positions piloted with at least 10% of participants being womenAt least 3 awareness-raising activities on gender inclusive initiatives and practices (covering topics of women's safety features in vehicles, gender equality at work and zero tolerance to sexual harassment) for GMPL’s staff, contractors and business partners conducted.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Consultations in various forms, including interviews with key stakeholders and meetings with communities, was conducted as part of project preparation. ADB’s policy document ‘Initial Poverty and Social Analysis’ has been displayed on ADB’s website https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/ind-55288-001-ipsa.

The lands to be acquired for the Jambi-Rengat section fall under the jurisdictions of the Jambi Province and the Riau Province.The Project including identified associated facilities may have impacts on seven protected areas including two key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) based on preliminary assessment. Therefore, a baseline data on local ecosystem and the biodiversity related to the proposed Project will be established prior to the commencement of the Project, and the impacts will be further assessed through a critical habitat assessment in line with ESS1 and international practices. Biodiversity surveys and assessment will be carried out as part of the ESIA and a Biodiversity Management Plan will also be prepared. Other environmental impacts of the Project will be temporary and localized, which will take place mostly during construction and maintenance periods. They include air pollution, noise, water contamination, landslide and soil erosion, change of surface water/groundwater and drainage, the implications on ecosystem, impacts of borrow areas and quarry, and the disposal of solid wastes, disturbance to communities, public utilities and traffic and risks to occupational health and safety. The impacts during the operation of the road mainly include traffic noise and vehicle emissions. The management, mitigation, and monitoring measures to address environmental risks and impacts will be included in the ESMP. The climate financing will also be estimated in line with the joint MDB methodology.Based on the LAPDs prepared by the Provincial Governments of Riau Province and of Jambi Province, almost all of the land parcels in the Jambi – Rengat section are used as plantations while a very small proportion is used either as agricultural fields, settlements, or roads. A LARP that is compliant with ESP and ESS2 requirements will be prepared to address any impacts arising from land acquisition. The preliminary draft of the domestic EIA identifies Indigenous Peoples at the northern section of the Jambi-Rengat segment not financed by AIIB (Sentjalang-Rengat segment). Due diligence will further confirm presence of Indigenous Peoples and/or customary areas along the Jambi-Rengat footprint.Public consultations have been carried out during the preparation of EIA and LAPDs. Additional consultations will be held during the preparation of the ESIA and the LARP and will ensure meaningful and inclusive participation, with views and concerns of the communities adequately addressed. A tailored Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) for the Project will be prepared to guide the further consultations throughout the Project cycle. Based on stakeholder consultation feedback, the ESIA and other ES documentations will be finalized. The final ESIA and LARP will be available in the English and local language (Bahasa) and be disclosed both online (on the websites of the client and AIIB) and made available in hard copy in the project area.A project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be established in accordance with the requirements of AIIB’s ESP.

An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) accompanied by two Environmental Management Plans (EMP), two Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans (LARPs) and a Gender Action Plan (GAP) have been prepared.Environment Aspects.By enhancing the safety and efficiency of a clean mode of transport, the Project is expected to contribute to a reduction of air emissions by replacing diesel locomotive and model shift from road transport. The railway line does not traverse through any protected areas or buffer zones, however, there are some key biodiversity areas (KBAs) including several Important Bird Areas (IBAs) on the wider surroundings of the project site (in 50km from the alignment). Thus, a biodiversity assessment and Critical Habitat Assessment (CHA) have been conducted. During the process of the assessments, the designer and Uzbekistan Railways (O’zbekiston Temir Yo’llari (UTY)) decided to re-route two sections of transmission lines (TLs) to avoid sensitive areas. The CHA concluded that there will be no significant or irreversible impacts expected with the mitigations embedded in the EMPs and in the Biodiversity Management Plan. Other adverse environmental impacts of this Project are largely temporary and localized and can be well managed following the EMPs.Climate Change Risks and Opportunities.The whole Project is considered a Climate Mitigation Financing (AIIB loan: USD 108.0 million) as it (i) reduces the carbon intensity of train travel, and (ii) induces modal shift away from road transport. Anticipated estimated GHG emission reduction will be 81,000 tCO2 /year. Climate adaptation has also been embedded into the Project design.Social Aspects.The Project design will not lead to physical resettlement, though economic resettlement and land acquisition will occur on agricultural lands and small farms. Land will be acquired temporarily for the construction of the pylons and the stringing of the cables during the construction phase. The draft LARPs and corresponding budgets were prepared based on desktop review and limited field surveys, due to COVID-19 restrictions. Detailed measuring, census and socio-economic surveys, impacts on crops, and vulnerability assessments will be undertaken upon finalization of detailed design to finalize the LARPs and corresponding Entitlement Matrices prior initiation of civil works.Stakeholder Consultation and Information Disclosure.In March and August 2020, prior to governmental-mandated quarantines, public consultations and meetings took place in the districts of the Khorezm province adjoining to Khiva. The IEE and LARPs have been disclosed on the websites of UTY andADBinUzbek,RussianandEnglishlanguages.

TheInvitation for Tenderswas published on February 12, 2021.Once built, the Project will be operated by Izmir Metro (IM), a municipal entity, under an indefinite lease agreement with the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality (IMM).","Environmental and Social Policy and Categorization.The proposed financing will be co-financed with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the Project's environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with EBRD’s Environmental and Social Policy 2019 (EBRD's ESP) and relevant Performance Requirements (PRs). To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing environmental and social (ES) aspects of the Project, and as permitted by AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB’s ESP), EBRD’s ESP relevant PRs will apply to this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. The Bank has reviewed EBRD’s ESP and PRs and is satisfied that i) the EBRD ESP and PRs are consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP and the relevant ES Standards (ESS); and ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. This Project has been assigned Category B in accordance with EBRD’s ESP (equivalent to Category B if AIIB’s ESP were applied) since the environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts are relatively limited, reversable, localized, and will mainly occur during the construction phase.An independent consultant has conducted an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) study to identify and assess the environmental and social impacts associated with the construction and operation of the proposed metro line and subsequently an ESAP has been prepared. The ESDD includes audits on the corporate ES policies and management systems of a) Izmir Metropolitan Municipality (IMM) responsible for construction, b) Izmir Metro responsible for operation and c) the contractors of the ongoing metro project. The areas that need to be improved are included in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP).Environmental and Social aspects.The Project is expected to result in safer and more reliable transport services for local passengers and will help to reduce traffic congestion, noise pollution and air pollution deriving out of transport modal shift.The Project consists of 13.4 km underground metro line with 11 stations, which means that impacts during construction will be largely confined the areas around the new stations. These stations will be built on state owned lands in residential areas and so will not require any private land acquisition and/or resettlement of private assets/buildings. Some local businesses around the metro stations can be affected due to temporary construction and nuisance such as traffic congestion, noise, and dust impacts. Other impacts anticipated during the construction phase will include occupational health and safety, labor and working conditions of contractor employees, emergency planning, noise and potential vibration risks to the old buildings, cultural heritage impacts particularly at Kasaplar Square and waste and wastewater management throughout construction phase. The project will not impact any biodiversity or nature reserve areas or national parks.During the operation phase, the potential impacts will include noise, indoor air pollution control, and management of fire safety risks, labor issues and community safety and security issues during transportation, which are less significant. Management of gender-based violence and harassment risks (GBVH) to workers and communities are identified as an area for improvement during ESDD in line with the new 2019 ESP.To mitigate these impacts during construction and operation phases of the metro, specific mitigation measures are identified and agreed in the ESAP. The client is required to undertake the measures defined in the ESAP and monitor the implementation during the lifetime of the project.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has been developed to ensure conduct of regular engagement with the affected people and vulnerable people, wider communities, local and national government, and non-governmental organizations, and media to inform them about project activities, plans and developments on an ongoing basis, and gather any complaints or feedback.

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable to the project. The project has been categorized as Category B, considering the nature and scale of the activities, which has a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (E&S) impacts limited to the project area; few if any of them are irreversible; and can be readily mitigated by following good practice in an operational setting.The project will deliver positive E&S benefits through improving the climate resilience of GACS, water resource conservation and increasing the agricultural productivity. The predicted negative impacts are mainly from construction during the project implementation period, such as noise, dust, tree felling and vegetation clearance, air emissions from construction machinery and vehicle, soil erosion, water contamination, solid waste disposal, occupational and community health and safety issues. During operation phase, increase in the use of agro-chemicals can be an indirect impact resulting from improved irrigation in the project area, and in addition a strengthened baseline analysis on the silt/sediment quality and source analysis of heavy metal pollution will be carried out, and the results reflected in an updated ESIA/ESMP to prevent future pollution during canal operation. The project is unlikely to involve land acquisition since all works will be within the available right-of-way (ROW). To address any potential displacement impacts for the distribution canals, a Resettlement Planning Framework complying with ESS 2 has been prepared.An Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) was undertaken for the five contract packages already awarded to verify whether E&S management of the tendered packages are in compliance with AIIB’s ESP. Consultations were conducted with the safeguards officers of the contractors to understand the level of implementation of the safeguard requirements as indicated in the bid document/ contract agreement. To identify the potential impacts of the awarded five sections, reconnaissance and transect walk surveys were carried out and consultations were conducted in all the five packages. Focus group discussions were held with farmers, villagers, village leaders of the farming communities and field level staff of the village panchayats.The ROW of the canal consists of the main canal, its bunds, service roads and embankments of the canal and based on the survey, it was observed that the project does not involve any loss on residential structures or crops due to project activities and no additional land acquisition was required for the purpose of implementation of the project activities. The ESDD did not identify significant non-compliance or legacy issues on environmental management for the five ongoing packages, but contractor’s agreement will be updated with the environmental mitigation and monitoring measures as in the ESMP.A Gender Action Plan (GAP) has been prepared for the project, which will benefit women through (i) capacity building programs for WRD female staff, (ii) increased participation in water management through membership in WUAs, and (iii) increased income from improved agricultural productivity.Consultations have been undertaken during the preparation of the E&S instruments and based on community feedback, the ES instruments have been finalized. The consultations will continue during the project implementation. The draft versions of ESIA with ESMP, RPF and ESDD in English have been published in the websites of WRD and AIIB along with the executive summaries in Tamil. WRD will monitor ESMP implementation throughout the Project implementation period. WRD will also prepare bi-annual E&S monitoring reports and submit the reports to AIIB for review.

Improved debt management and sustainability, private sector development, as well as higher female labor force participation will enhance the recovery of the Egyptian economy over the medium term.","This Loan will be co-financed with the WB as lead co-financier, and the program’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the WB’s DPF Policy. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to DPF operations. Therefore, as permitted by the decision of the AIIB’s Board of Directors set forth in the Decisions to Support the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility, the WB’s DPF Policy will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the program.In accordance with its DPF Policy, the WB has reviewed the specific policies supported under the program to determine whether they are likely to have significant social and poverty consequences (especially on the poor and vulnerable groups) or to cause significant effects on the country’s environment and other natural resources. The WB has determined that these policies are likely to have positive overall environmental and social effects, as described in the WB’s Program Document. The proposed prior actions will have a net positive environmental impact due to the expected increased capacity and efficiency in managing solid wastes and the adoption of green finance instruments for sovereign projects. The current legal environmental framework in Egypt has adequate requirements to address the moderate potential environmental impacts associated with the priority actions of this Program.The poverty and social analysis conducted by WB indicates that actions supported by the Program encourage inclusive growth through enabling private sector participation and fostering gender inclusion. This will have overall potentially positive effects on poverty and inequality reduction. Some of the policy actions, such as increasing the use of digital payments, are expected to have additional positive impact.The Program addresses the gender gap by enabling women’s effective economic participation. Reforms under Pillar 3 (fostering women’s economic inclusion) aim to: (i) remove regulatory barriers hindering female labor participation; (ii) prevent and address Gender Based Violence, and (iii) enhance access to finance for women. Removing regulatory barriers will allow women to participate in economic activities that they were previously prohibited from engaging in. GBV is a constraint to women’s voice and agency, and it also directly affects economic opportunities as a result of work absenteeism for both men and women, and mental and physical health which in turn affects the next generations.",,,OK

These impacts are expected to be localized, temporary and reversible, which can be mitigated effectively through mitigation management measures.The key social risks are construction induced impacts, inequitable distribution of benefits, inadequate stakeholder engagement, ineffective grievance redress mechanism, occupational health and safety issues, and gender-based violence issues related to increased influx of labor. The PAP has provided recommendations to address these risks focused on strengthening capacities for reporting on social risk management, improving social inclusion and stakeholder engagement, closing gender gaps, managing land acquisition and resettlement. To address gender gaps, the Program will support capacity development with an emphasis on building an integrated approach across agencies for implementing the safe-city program in Chennai.This Program will support strengthening of systems for all key participating agencies for citizen outreach and consultation, preparation and public disclosure of annual performance reports by implementing agencies, use of consumer feedback and satisfaction surveys to enhance service delivery, and grievance redressal for all key participating agencies.

Starting in early March 2021, a new surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases has led the Government to tighten the restriction of public activities to contain and reduce the spread of the disease. Despite the recent improvement in the Azerbaijan’s public-sector-led healthcare system in providing universal basic medical care in public hospitals, the growing number of COVID-19 cases has placed significant stress on the initial testing and diagnosis, prevention, and treatment capacity of the system due to inadequate specialized medical facilities, staff, and equipment. Essential health services for emergency care, chronic illnesses and surgical procedures have been challenged due to prioritization on the pandemic.To mitigate the adverse socioeconomic impacts of COVD-19 pandemic, an inter-agency COVID-19 Task Force chaired by the Prime Minister was established along with working groups under key ministries. The government approved the first Action Plans on January 30, 2020. Following the President’s Executive Decree on 19 March 2020, the government has allocated AZN 3.5 billion (USD 2.06 billion or 4.8 percent of GDP) to implement the pro-poor countercyclical pandemic response package, covering Health-related, Social Protection and Macroeconomic Stabilization measures. In responding to the recent surge of new COVID-19 cases in 2021, the government has recently approved an additional budget of USD 1.77 billion (3.6 percent of GDP) to extend and expand the implementation of the countercyclical pandemic response program that has started in 2020.Due to the deteriorating fiscal situation, the total fiscal deficit is expected to reach USD 2.61 billion in 2021, of which the domestic financing will cover USD 2.26 billion, while the external financing will be USD 350 million, closing the financing gap. Through the ADB COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure support (CARES) program under the Countercyclical Support Facility Option (CPRO), ADB has prepared to finance USD 250 million while AIIB has been requested by the Government to provide USD 100 million of sovereign-back financing to bridge the financing gap. The Government will finance the rest of the pandemic response package of USD 1.42 billion.The proposed program structure comprises of three Countercyclical COVID-19 Pandemic Response Measures:A. Enhancement the Government’s COVID-19 response and health system;B. Expansion of social protection for the poor and vulnerable; andC. Assistance to impacted economic sectors to prevent job losses from economic downturn due to COVID-19 mitigation and prevention measures.","This Loan will be co-financed with the ADB as lead co-financier, and the Program’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the provisions of ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) applicable to policy-based lending (PBL).

Therefore, as permitted by the decision of the AIIB’s Board of Directors set forth in the Decisions to Support the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility, the provisions of ADB’s SPS applicable to PBL will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the Program.Under its SPS, ADB has categorized the program as Category C each for environment, involuntary resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples on the basis of an assessment of the countercyclical expenditures to be supported by the Program support towards (i) COVID-19 response and health system strengthening measures, (ii) Social protection for the poor and vulnerable households expanded, and (iii) Affected sectors supported to prevent job losses from the economic downturn, and concludes that the program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts. These focus on expanding and strengthening social safety nets for the poor and most vulnerable groups, strengthening COVID-19 response and are not expected to have any adverse environmental or social impacts.The Program is categorized by ADB as “effective gender mainstreaming at entry”, and has included gender measures including among others (i) continuous supply of appropriately-sized personal protective equipment to at least 64,000 healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients, including individual packages for female healthcare workers; (ii) provision of additional payments in the range of 3-5-fold increase in monthly wages to at least 64,000 healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients, of which at least 65% are women; (iii) coverage of at least 90% of the population under the mandatory health insurance, of which 50% are women; (iv) increase in the number of low-income households receiving support under TSA to at least 80,000, covering 335,000 individuals, of which 50% are women; and (v) increase in average monthly old-age pension payments by at least 15% and continuous provision of pensions to more than 742,000 old-age pensioners, of which at least 63% are women.",,Category C,OK

Link to the ES documents have been disclosed by theWorld BankandAIIB.The ESSA has included provisions for identifying the environmental risks of this Program, including physical risks, contextual risks, institutional capacity risks and political and reputational risk. These are expected to have only minor, reversible impacts.The Program is likely to have overall positive social impacts, especially in the areas where interventions are planned. Key social risks arise due to the possibility of exclusion of a set of vulnerable groups, such as: (i) small and marginal farmers, as they have limited resources for farm innovations (or insurance) and less access to water compared to those owning larger lands; (ii) tribal and women farmers, who are mostly landless tenants or agricultural laborers and are denied agricultural incentives that usually go to landowners; (iii) poor and socially marginalized from Urban Local Body-led development or DRM plans that fail to recognize their peculiar vulnerabilities; and (iv) tribal communities, whose habitations are remote and upland and are usually the last to receive road access. However, none of these are irreversible risks that cannot be mitigated using effective social management practices of participation, community engagement, accountability, and transparency.The Program intends to adopt a ‘basin-wide approach’ along the Pamba river basin, which is home to several indigenous communities, In the roads sector, there is substantial risk of physical and economic displacement of squatters, encroachers and vendors. The Program will exclude (i) any town/city to be selected, if the spatial planning is likely to adversely impact existing settlements or resources accessed by indigenous communities residing within or near municipal limits and (ii) any road repair and maintenance works requiring resettlement and removal of structures (on a single alignment/ package) impacting more than 50 persons.Grievance management mechanisms relevant to the Program have been considered for their appropriateness across various agencies. A Program level Grievance Redress Mechanism will be established to complement and strengthen existing ones, and to make them more transparent and responsive.

The project has been identified as Category A, based on the available information, particularly considering the project environmental and social impacts and risks, and their scale that may be substantial, significant, cumulative, diverse, and partially permanent in nature, as well as due to land acquisition, potential physical displacements and resettlement. AnEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)andEnvironmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), andResettlement Action Plan (RAP)have been prepared.Environmental Aspects.During the ESIA process, baseline survey, screening and scoping of environmental impacts/risks, alternative analysis, and impact assessment and mitigation measures have been undertaken. At the same time, the environmental sensitive receptors/locations for acoustic, air, water, and ecological environment, have been identified and assessed. There are two ecologically sensitive locations along the project road alignments, however, there is no national and local protected species and no endangered flora and fauna in the project areas. The ESIA process has resulted in the conclusion that the environmental and social impacts and risks are substantial, and will be reduced, limited and controlled through adequate mitigation measures, management (Environmental and Social Management Plan) and monitoring. The ESMP will address adverse impacts related to ecosystem, water environment, noise, vibration, atmospheric environment, solid wastes, occupational health and safety, and labor management. As part of ESIA preparation, public/stakeholder consultation and information disclosure have been carried out at various stages to share the project information and to obtain opinions from stakeholders.Social Aspects.Key social risks associated with the project are related to land acquisition and physical and/or economic displacements. According to surveys carried out, construction activities will involve 1597.87 mu of permanent land acquisition and 677 mu of temporary occupation of land with over 80 percent of acquired land belonging to farmland. The land acquisition and temporary occupation will directly affect 967 households from eight villages in Tiandeng and Daxin Counties in Chongzuo City. For such impacts, adequate compensation and rehabilitation will be provided based on established national laws, local regulations and AIIB’s ESP. A detailed RAP has been prepared based on the magnitude of impact, social economic survey, and extensive consultations among affected people and communities. Other adverse social impacts and risks during the operation and maintenance phase are mostly associated with noise and possibility of road accidents. The ESMP, mentioned earlier, includes measures to address the above impacts, including a chance finds procedure for archaeological, historical, and sacred sites.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.Consultations have been held during the preparation of ESIA and RAP. Awareness raising and focused discussions with Party leaders, Village leaders and women’s representatives have also taken place. During construction, the Government of Chongzuo City is required to regularly conduct consultations with the local communities and report on these consultations on a monthly basis.

Given that this is only the second ever such issuance in Asia, the Project will set benchmarks for future primary issuances which is a critical part of the market-building process for any new asset class.","In line with previous capital markets projects executed by AIIB, Bayfront has developed and maintained (1) anEnvironmental & Social (E&S) Frameworkwhich acts as the basis for a robust E&S due diligence for every loan acquisition and (2)Sustainable Finance Frameworkwhich provides the basis for issuance of green, social or sustainability notes. The Project involves a potential investment into an issuance of IABS and includes a sustainability tranche. The proceeds from the sustainability tranche will be used to finance and/or refinance the purchase of loans for renewable energy and affordable social infrastructure projects (Eligible Loans).In place of AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (“ESP”), the Project team proposes to apply Bayfront’s E&S Framework, supplemented by the Sustainable Finance Framework for the sustainable tranche of the operation. The Project team has confirmed Bayfront is adhering to the requirements of its frameworks and that it has the capacity to address E&S concerns arising under this operation.1. The E&S Framework, which would apply to the entire operation, includes criteria to (i) evaluate the E&S performance of each underlying asset and its key counterparties in the portfolio (including E&S related reputational risks) as part of the initial red flags screening. Loans are (ii) screened against Bayfront’s E&S exclusion list (which is consistent with the Bank’s Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL)) and (iii) categorized. They are then (iv) assigned an E&S risk rating, which determines the extent of monitoring and oversight required post acquisition. Lastly, sector specific E&S risks are (v) addressed by Sector Guides.2. The Sustainable Finance Framework, which would apply to the sustainability tranche of this operation, has been reviewed and a Second Party Opinion (SPO) has been provided for alignment with key International Capital Market Association (ICMA) guidelines including Green Bond Principles (GBP 2018), Social Bond Principles (2020) and Sustainable Bond Guidelines (2018). The initial aggregate par amount of Eligible Loan exceeds the proposed principal amount of the sustainability tranche and investment into these sustainable assets will contribute towards the advancement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The rationale for the derogation from the application of ESP is the following:1. The ESP is designed for lending to conventional project finance investments and is not ‘fit for purpose’ for capital markets instruments.2. Bayfront purchases infrastructure loans in the secondary market from originating financing institutions (most, if not all, of whom have adopted the Equator Principles) and the management of E&S risks is therefore only feasible through a rules-based framework governing the selection of loans and underlying projects.During project administration, AIIB may request E&S performance information of the portfolio. All investors will receive the annual sustainability tranche post-issuance report including total amount of proceeds allocated to eligible loans, number of eligible loans and others. The impact reporting of the sustainability tranche will include metrics such as estimated annual GHG emissions avoided, number of people with access to clean water and other-related indicators.",,,OK

The loan was disbursed in May 2020, and the EMCP has remained on track. However, the abrupt outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has created a large and unanticipated financing gap while significantly constraining the GoG’s financing sources.

This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the environmental and social risks and impacts of the Program.In accordance with the DPF Policy, the WB has reviewed the measures under the Program to determine whether they are likely to have significant negative social impacts or result in increased poverty (especially for the poor and vulnerable groups) or to cause significant negative effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. The activities included in the Program are expected to yield positive social impacts in the medium to long-term. Improved fiscal risk management and more transparent public procurement and investment systems are amongst the expected social benefits. The Program’s actions are not expected to carry environmental risk; on the contrary, some actions are expected to have positive impacts on the environment. More effective policy implementation is expected with stronger requirements for ES assessments for public investment projects and introduction of regulatory impact assessments requiring an assessment of the impact of proposed policies on the environment.In the immediate term, the Loan will help to finance the Government’s robust health, social protection and economic response, thus helping to protect lives and livelihoods. This will support some of the poorest and most vulnerable Georgians to cope and recover from the current health and economic crisis. By preserving the reform momentum, over the medium to long term, gains from improved economic management are expected to increase fiscal space that could be allocated to address emerging priorities, enhance fiscal stability, and improve access to public service emergency programs.

The process was carried out in accordance with the EBRD Procurement Policies and Rules (https://www.ebrd.com/work-with-us/procurement/policies-and-rules.html) and the contract was awarded on June 4, 2018, to Gülermak Ağır Sanayi İnşaat ve Taahhüt A.Ş. (Gülermak). Turning over of premises to the contractor was carried out on June 25, 2018 and the Project’s physical progress is reported 57 percent as of April 2020.Once built, the Project will be operated by Izmir Metro, a municipal entity, under an indefinite lease agreement with the Izmir Metropolitan Municipality (IMM).","Environmental and Social Policy and Categorization.This Project has been prepared and implemented to date in accordance with EBRD’s Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD’s ESP) and EBRD’s Performance Requirements (PRs), both dated May 2014. In order to ensure a harmonized approach to the environmental and social (ES) aspects of this Project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB’s ESP), EBRD’s ESP and relevant PRs will apply to the project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB is satisfied that: (a) EBRD’s ESP and PRs are consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and are materially consistent with AIIB’s ESP, including its relevant Environmental and Social Standards and (b) the monitoring procedures that EBRD and AIIB have in place are appropriate for the Project. EBRD has assigned Category “B” to this Project due to limited and site-specific environmental and social (ES) risks of this Project that can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to relevant performance requirements, procedures, guidelines or design criteria.An Environment and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) Report with an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) was prepared in March 2018 prior to the construction. The ESAP has been updated annually and submitted to EBRD.AIIB has conducted an Environmental and Social Review (ESR). The corrective actions have been incorporated into the updated ESAP.Environmental aspect.This Project is expected to expand the public transport network in Izmir, facilitate the transport modal shift and decrease travel time, which will generate socio-economic benefits and reduce noise, air pollution and congestion caused by vehicles. This Project will generate adverse impacts mostly during the construction phase. The ESR confirms that various management plans have been prepared and are being implemented by the Contractor to address the adverse environmental impacts and occupational health and safety risks. The Client has been satisfactorily supervising the management of ES risks and impacts of this Project.The ESDD Report notes that the client’s energy management system includes periodic monitoring, review and reporting of its energy and fuel consumption, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Social aspect.The ESDD Report and the ESR report both indicated that no land acquisition and/or resettlement would occur related to the Project as the lands needed for the construction of the metro line and stations belong to the City. The ESR confirmed that the station designs, and construction methods were selected to minimize physical and economic displacement. The ESR indicated there were nine (9) project design changes but did not entail additional land acquisition.Gender and disability.The ESR confirmed that there have been no reported incidents related to sexual harassment and violence in the project.

The country systems applicable to the Program were reviewed to ascertain their adequacy to manage ES risks and impacts as identified during the ESSA. The country’s legislation related to ES safeguards for the Program was found to be adequate. Consequently, the country’s ES management system, based on the ESSA, will be applied to the Program given that the ES risks and impacts are limited in their scope and can be successfully managed by known and tested measures.Risk areas of concern include medical waste and wastewater; Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) for medical workers; community health and safety related to the handling of medical waste; transportation, treatment and isolation of people with confirmed COVID-19 and/or people who may have COVID-19; poor consent processes; communication and outreach; and privacy concerns due to mass surveillance.

Meanwhile, the pandemic triggered severe economic slowdown in the country. Mongolia’s economy has limited diversification and is highly dependent on the mining sector, which accounts for 24% of its gross domestic product (GDP) and almost 90% of its exports. Its high dependency on trade makes the country particularly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.The government of Mongolia has put together a comprehensive set of response measures to mitigate the COVID-19 impact. The measures include the Countercyclical Development Expenditure Program (CDEP), which consists of three packages: (1) support to public health protection; (2) social protection to support citizens and businesses; and (3) support to vulnerable businesses and fiscal stimulus measures.The proposed Mongolia COVID-19 Rapid Response Program (the Program) will assist the government’s response to COVID-19 pandemic, support the implementation of its CDEP to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on the economy, and support poverty alleviation. The Program will support the three packages of the CDEP: public health protection, social protection, and fiscal stimulus measures.","This Loan will be co-financed with the ADB as lead co-financier, and the Program’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with the provisions of ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 (SPS) applicable to policy-based lending. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP) was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to policy-based operations. Therefore, as permitted by the decision of the AIIB’s Board of Directors set forth in the Decisions to Support the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility, the provisions of the SPS applicable to policy based lending will apply to this operation in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. This will ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the Program.Under its SPS, ADB has categorized the Program as Category C for Environment, Involuntary Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples, respectively, on the basis of an assessment of the countercyclical expenditures to be supported by the Program. These focus on expanding and strengthening social safety nets for the most vulnerable groups and are not expected to have adverse ES impacts. The Program is also categorized by ADB as “effective gender mainstreaming”, as it has set targets to ensure vulnerable female employees benefit from tailored social protection and job retention programs, suspension of personal income tax, and compulsory and voluntary social insurance premiums. The Program will also support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) owned by women and businesses where women make up a significant number of employees.

Being a densely populated country with a large number of internal and external migrant workers, Bangladesh is very vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. The country has already faced significant healthcare challenges in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases in the country has been significantly increasing; as of May 6, 2020, number of confirmed cases are 11,719. On Mar 25, 2020, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) imposed a lockdown which has been extended till May 30, 2020, and is likely to extend further as this crisis continues to evolve rapidly, and the ultimate fallout is difficult to predict.The pandemic has seriously impacted the country’s economy. The extended closure of business establishments and offices as well as other social distancing measures result in simultaneous supply and demand shocks, with production, consumption, trade and investment all at a standstill. The traditional growth engines of the country’s economy – export-oriented industries, remittances and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have all ground to a halt. As a result, the poor and the vulnerable will likely bear the brunt of the impact. Thus, the GoB has undertaken fiscal countercyclical expenditure programs to strengthen healthcare services, and provide direct support for the poor and vulnerable groups and for businesses to protect jobs.The Program is expected to increase GoB’s spending on crisis measures with a focus on social and economic protection. The following key outputs are expected: (i) employment opportunities are protected; and (ii) social safety net to vulnerable groups expanded.","AIIB’s ESP was designed to apply to investment projects and has no provisions for its application to policy-based lending operations.

The Project is placed in Category B given that the number of potentially adverse environmental and social impacts are limited, not unprecedented or irreversible, and can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting, as confirmed by the Project Team’s field visit and review of the E&S documentation prepared for the Project.The proposed Project site was undeveloped due to its unsuitability for agriculture, seldom used for cattle grazing due its limited vegetation coverage and lack of water sources, and the presence of only few fauna and flora species was identified. Less than one third of the 233.5 hectares of leased land will be occupied by permanent facilities, while the remaining land will, after temporary disturbance caused by the Project, will again be accessible to herders. The avian migratory corridor nearest to the WPP migration lies 20 kilometers to the north along the Kyzylkol, Sorkol, Akkol lake system that is visited by over 75 species of waterfowl. Only 21 species were observed at the site during the spring and autumn bird surveys, and bird numbers were relatively low. The specialist study concluded that the impacts of the Project on avian fauna will be minimal due to its location, which is largely unsuitable for nesting and rarely crossed by migratory birds, and the low altitude flight patterns – below the 30m to 150m risk zone of the blades’ span – of the species observed at site. The avoidance of Greenhouse Gas emissions from renewable energy generation has been calculated to be 265,864tCO2 equivalent per year.Six neighboring farms, located over 2km from the nearest installation, were leasing land from the government’s State Reserve land that was transferred to the Project as part of the 233.5 hectares allocated to the WPP. These 54 hectares represent less than one percent of the total land leased to community members, and twenty-three percent of the Project’s total land lease. These Project-Affected People documented their relinquishment of a small portion of their leased land and in the course of interviews conducted as part of the ESIA confirmed they had no economic or other interest in the area relinquished. Since land acquisition was completed by the time the E&S documentation was prepared, the Company has commissioned a Land Acquisition Audit against ESS 2 requirements, and committed to implement necessary livelihood restoration measures.An archeological survey of the locations of the initial 51 turbines was conducted in November 2017 by a licensed archaeological company and identified 33 burial mounds, 22 of which are between 20 meters and 120 meters from the turbines. All 33 mounds were included in the list of the cultural heritage, and excavation of cultural materials at the 22 mounds nearest to facilities was completed by a licensed archeologist. Authorization to proceed with construction beyond a 50-meter buffer zone around the remaining 11 mounds was provided by the relevant authorities. The ESIA Consultant identified 4 remaining mounds located less than 50m from the internal roads. Either the road alignments will need to be altered or the mounds excavated by a licensed archeologist under supervision by the relevant authorities. A Chance Find Procedure was prepared to address any further archeological discovery during construction activities, including the construction of the powerline corridors, internal substation and storage areas, which were not covered in the 2017 archeological survey.Construction risks such as earthworks, excavations, work in height, heat exertion, and electrical hazards during operation have been assessed in the ESIA and the management measures defined in the ESMP. The influx of workers will be minimal, and they will in their vast majority be housed in the nearby Zhanatas town. Stakeholder consultation took place during the ESIA preparation and confirmed support for the Project and limited concern about its impacts. The Company has disclosed a Non-Technical Summary and its SEP in English and Russian and the Project’s environmental and social assessment in English on its website, accessible at: www.cpihzhanatas.kz. AIIB has also disclosed these documents on its site at:https://www.aiib.org/en/projects/details/2019/approved/Kazakhstan-Zhanatas-100-MW-Wind-Power-Plant.html. The Company has defined an external GRM in the SEP, and an internal GRM for project workers as part of its HR procedures.On-going monitoring will be conducted by the EPC during construction, while the Company will supervise implementation of all E&S management and mitigation measure and report annually to AIIB on its progress in implementing the ESMP and its E&S performance. Semi-annual bird surveys during the Spring and Autumn migratory periods will be required to be conducted by specialist ornithologists, and all bird strikes will need to be recorded.

Consequently, as permitted by the ESP, AIIB will apply the IFC Policy and IFC PSs to this Project.IFC’s engagement began during the project development stage in 2012, as part of IFC’s early project support through the IFC InfraVentures facility where IFC helped ensure that the Project’s Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) documentation was aligned with applicable World Bank Group (WBG) requirements. These efforts included but where not limited to the development of a robust environmental and social baseline, detailed impact and risks assessment, extensive stakeholder engagement and consultation, and development of management plans to adequately mitigate environmental, social, labor and occupational health and safety (ESHS) impacts and risks.In this context, IFC’s review involved a detailed assessment of the completeness and quality of the Project’s ESIA process, as well as related supplemental studies that were prepared as part of IFC’s early engagement. The scope of IFC’s review comprised, but was not limited to the following activities: (i) ongoing discussion with the Project Company’s ESHS management and advisors during the 2013-2018 period, including hiring an independent environmental and social consulting (IESC) firm to act on behalf of the Lenders’ group; (ii) review of planning documentation prepared for local approvals/permits, primarily consisting an ESIA (Regulatory ESIA-2012); (iii) scoping site visit performed in early 2013 to assess the necessary complementary ESIA studies and define the ESHS gaps that were required to be closed before formal project appraisal, resulting in a Scoping Reports (2013), the Supplemental ESIA and its related additional corrective actions; (iv) multiple field visits and stakeholder meetings and consultations in Kathmandu and the project site between 1Q2013 and 1Q2015, involving IFC E&S specialists and consultants; (v) a pre-2015 earthquake environmental and social appraisal site visit performed in April 2015 involving E&S specialists from the IFC and from other potential members of the Lenders’ group expected at the time, together with the IESC firm; (vi) multiple post-2015 earthquake field visits and stakeholder meetings and consultations in Kathmandu and the project site between 1Q2015 and 2Q2018, involving IFC E&S specialists and consultants to update the ESIA studies to the post-earthquake reality (specially on the social components) and close the outstanding gaps identified in the supplemental ESIA, which resulted in the Updated ESIA 2018 documentation and (vii) the final environmental and social appraisal site visit in April 2018 involving E&S specialists from the IFC, ADB, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), AIIB and FMO (Dutch Development Bank), together with the IESC firm.Furthermore, multiple site visits were performed by IFC and specialized consultants during 2018 in relation to the cumulative impact studies and the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process. These interventions have included providing resources and expertise to accomplish Nepal’s first FPIC process for Indigenous Peoples, a robust Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) of the Trishuli River basin, including a connectivity assessment, and post-earthquake relief and reconstruction support which contributed to continued engagement with project affected communities and social license to operate under difficult circumstances.AIIB’s environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) was initiated in April 2018 and benefited from the ESDD initiated earlier by IFC as described above. AIIB’s ESDD included a review of the instruments, a joint site visit, consultation with the PAPs and local and national authorities. The key environmental and social risks and impacts identified during the due diligence concern involuntary resettlement affecting economic displacement of 154 families and physical displacement of 10 families; special considerations for Indigenous Peoples (IPs); impacts to aquatic biodiversity; vulnerability to natural hazards; health, safety and security risks to Project workers and communities and the Sponsor’s capacity to manage such a complex Project in an environmentally and socially sensitive context.These risks and impacts are addressed in a series of environmental and social studies and instruments, engagement with the Project Company, and communication among the lenders. The Project Company has prepared a specific Gender Action Plan to ensure women’s participation in public meetings, awareness of Project activities and their associated health, safety and security risks, entitlement to project benefits and participation in its implementation and monitoring. Environmental and social undertakings issuing from all the E&S studies and instruments prepared for the Project, as well as requirements for capacity building for the Sponsors, EPC Contractor and sub-contractor required for their implementation are defined in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), which is currently being finalized amongst the Lenders group and the Sponsors and would be reflected in the financing agreements.Consultation activities included public meetings in affected communities, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, meetings with other external stakeholders and governmental administration agencies. Extensive feedback from PAPs and broader stakeholders was collected, reviewed by the Project Company, its consultants and addressed in the environmental and social instruments, which are available in English and in many cases in Nepali, and can be found on theIFC’s websiteas well as theProject Company’s website.",,Category A,OK

Ltd. (Bayfront, or the Platform) that purchases infrastructure debts from financial institutions and distributes them to institutional investors through securitization or other formats. This supports private capital mobilization and builds infrastructure as an asset class. The purchase of such debts is predicated on the hypothesis that financial institutions that currently originate and hold such debts to maturity will increasingly be constrained from doing so with the advent of Basel lll regulations.","The Project resulted in the establishment of a platform to purchase infrastructure debts from financial institutions, structure and distribute them to institutional investors through securitization or other distribution formats. In line with previous capital markets projects executed by AIIB, this platform has developed and maintains an appropriate environmental and social (“E&S”) framework. A summary of the framework can be foundhere.In place of AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the project team has required the Platform to implement a robust Environmental and Social (E&S) framework integrated into its due diligence process before any loan acquisition and throughout the asset management phase. This framework involves screening debts against the Environmental and Social Exclusion List and other eligibility criteria, reviewing their original E&S categorization, available environmental and social assessments, monitoring documentation, and relevant loan covenants. Each debt is then assigned an E&S risk rating, reflecting its original categorization, E&S performance to date, and the Platform's exposure to residual E&S risks.The findings from this due diligence process are presented to the Platform’s Executive Committee or Board before any investment decision is made. The debts are thereafter monitored for their E&S performance and controversies. The Platform regularly provides AIIB, its shareholder, with insights into the E&S performance of the portfolio as well as the E&S characteristics of the project pipeline. The E&S framework has also been expanded to include not only project finance debts for single assets but also corporate debts.The rationale for the proposed approach is as follow:The ESP is designed for lending to new projects and is not ‘fit for purpose’ for application to the capital markets or debt and equity security instruments.Debts are mostly purchased in the secondary market, and the management of environmental and social risks is only feasible through rules based ESG framework governing the selection of debts and the underlying projects.Debts to be acquired are typically backed by existing assets that are either complete or nearing completion; in this context, environmental and social risks are more effectively managed through robust ESG criteria that govern debt selection.A key objective of the Project is to encourage banks to originate sustainable infrastructure projects, eligible for purchase by the Platform, through the application of robust ESG criteria.By adopting an ESG framework, the Platform can offer investors greater transparency to investors on the overall ESG profile of the underlying assets, thereby helping to position sustainability as a key, value-enhancing feature of this emerging asset class.",,,OK

Under the WB’s Safeguard Policies, the proposed project has been assigned Category A, which is consistent with the provisions of the Bank’s ESP.The main environmental concern is the potential adverse impacts on the Tuz Golu (Salt Lake). The Salt Lake has been designated a Special Environmental Protected Area by the Turkish Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. The ongoing WB financed project’s potential impacts on the protected area were assessed as part of the original environmental assessment and revisited with additional studies in 2013. Both assessments concluded that there were no significant adverse impacts on the Salt Lake. The brine solution has the same characteristics as the natural inflows to the lake and the total amount of brine solution discharged is not significantly affecting the amount of water in the lake. Monitoring will continue under implementation of the expansion project.The project’s social concerns include impacts on downstream users of Hirfanli Dam and the economic and livelihood impacts due to involuntary land acquisition. During the preparation of the additional finance for the WB’s ongoing project, dam safety assurance measures were agreed with the dam operator (State Hydraulic Works or DSI), Electricity Generation Corporation of Türkiye (EUAŞ) and BOTAŞ for implementation by the DSI field organization. These measures have been updated and revised in line with the WB review for the proposed project, including the Operations and Maintenance Plan. They did not involve significant and complex remedial works. Since the details of the exact land requirement are still unknown, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in line with the World Bank’s OP/BP 4.12 has been prepared. Corresponding Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for different project sub-components will be prepared and implemented by BOTAS to reflect the final design. Both the land acquisition process and potential nuisances impacting community members in the Project’s area of influence will be covered in the Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM), which comprises the state-managed national GRM, and a project-level GRM managed by BOTAŞ.The ESIA also provides frameworks for the sub-management plans (e.g. waste management, biodiversity action plans, labor influx management, traffic management plan, occupational health and safety management plan, etc.) and requires the contractor to finalize these plans and submit them for BOTAŞ’ approval.Following two rounds of public consultations, the environmental and social safeguard instruments including the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMP), GRM and the RPF have been disclosed and can be consulted at the following links:www.botas.gov.tr/docs/ihaleler/2018/ddb_GSEP_ESIA_Report.pdfwww.botas.gov.tr/docs/ihaleler/2018/ddb_Resettlement_Policy_Framework_RPF.pdfhttp://projects.worldbank.org/P162727/?lang=en&tab=documents&subTab=projectDocumentsFurther stakeholder engagement is planned throughout the course of the project implementation.",,Category A,OK

The Project has been classified as Category A. The Project is located within the Gaurishankar Conservation Area (GCA); however, the “Regulatory” Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of TV-HEP, approved by the Ministry of Environment in June 2016, concludes that the Project is “environmentally feasible and the identified impacts in physical, biological, socioeconomic and cultural environment are mostly ranked as low to moderate and these impacts could be managed to an acceptable level by applying proper preventive, mitigation and rehabilitation measures.” AIIB has determined that preparation of a Supplemental Environmental and Social Information Package will be necessary to fully understand the potential environmental and social risks and impacts of the Project and identify proposed measures for their management in a manner consistent with the ESP. Land acquisition is expected to be limited to 28.5 hectares for the construction of the Project structure and facilities. In total, 35 households with 177 persons are tentatively 3 estimated to be affected by land acquisition, mostly limited to economic displacement. Only two of these households are expected to be physically displaced to date. At the same time, since the basin is experiencing rapid hydropower development, with 586MW under construction in the GCA, including the UTKHEP (456MW), there could be significant cumulative impacts, resulting in complete conversion of the Tamakoshi aquatic ecosystem into modified habitat. During project preparation, the Supplemental Environmental and Social Information Package will be prepared to address information gaps identified during the Bank’s initial site visit (Sept. 2018). This will include, but not be limited to, an assessment of climate change risks, downstream impacts, and a cumulative impact assessment that will include both the UTKHEP and the proposed Project. Stand-alone documents will include an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF), Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), Land Acquisition and Livelihood Restoration Plan (LALRP), Stakeholder Engagement Plan including Grievance Redress Mechanism, and a Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) that is informed by a Free, Prior, and Informed Consultation (FPICon) process. These studies will include, as appropriate, use of public disclosure and consultation processes to support their preparation. As per ESS 3, the Project will be required to undertake FPICon under the guidance of a qualified and experienced independent expert. FPICon is an enhanced consultation process that requires documentation of a mutually accepted process of consultation between the Project and the concerned Indigenous Peoples and evidence of Broad Community Support of these communities on the outcome of the negotiations. As the Project is on an international waterway, the Bank will conduct a review of the potential need for a riparian notification process, consistent with the provisions of the Operational Policy on International Relations.

Under the EBRD’s ESP, the Project has been assigned Category A, since the proposed hydropower scheme includes the construction of a large dam and the Project comprises a large and complex greenfield development, with a number of significant environmental and social risks and impacts. The Project construction will also require several associated facilities such as roads, quarries, a 220-kV transmission line and a 110-kV transmission line. In accordance with EBRD’s ESP and PRs for a Category A project, a formal and participatory Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been prepared by the Borrower. The Lenders’ group of environmental and social staff, including from the Bank, have undertaken several site visits and observed public consultations in the Project area and Tbilisi. The environmental and social documentation on the Project has been disclosed on the website of the Borrower, as follows:http://nenskra.ge/en/reports/Given the complexity of the Project, an international, interdisciplinary panel of experts (IPoE) was convened to provide additional oversight of and transparency in Project design and implementation arrangements. The IPoE has issued several reports on issues such as dam safety and stakeholder engagement, and these have been disclosed alongside the ESIA. Pertinent issues are summarised below; extensive information on these topics is presented in the ESIA: - Community safety, natural hazards – The area in which the Project is to be located is mountainous and natural hazards exist. The dam construction method, location, and foundation design have all been revised and adapted to mitigate the risks of natural hazards affecting dam integrity. - Physical resettlement –The physical resettlement of local populations has been avoided in entirety through design changes. While significant land take (882 hectares) is still required, the minimisation of resettlement-related impacts is an example of a positive outcome of the ESIA process. In total, 89 households are affected by either permanent or temporary land acquisition. - Indigenous Peoples – Some NGOs/CSOs strongly believe that Svans meet the defined criteria of Indigenous People as stipulated by EBRD’s ESP and thus should be treated as such for the purposes of the Project’s analysis. The ESIA provides a detailed analysis of the identity of the Svans vis-a-vis Lender policies, which confirms that PR7 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. - Protected areas – The Project area was within a proposed protected area (candidate Emerald site), The boundaries of this and other proposed candidate Emerald sites were later refined by the GoG, which resulted in the Project area being outside, but adjacent to, the current proposed protected area. The Borrower, however, adopted a precautionary approach; biodiversity assessments were undertaken in accordance with the EU Habitat Directive and EBRD PR6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources) and were integrated into the supplementary ESIA studies. 3 A Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been established for the Project with one office in Chuberi (Nenskra Valley) and one in Naki (Nakra Valley). In addition, concerns and complaints can also be lodged at the Project headquarters in Tbilisi or on the Borrower’s website. The GRM offices in Chuberi and Naki also serve as the platform for registering for employment and advertisement of job opportunities by the Borrower.

The proposed total debt financing for the Project is USD144 million which would primarily be used to fund the construction of the solar plant and other costs such as financing costs, contingency etc.","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List, Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management), and ESS 2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) shall apply to the Project. Since there are no indigenous community in the project area, ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. The Project has been classified as Category B since: (i) it has a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (E&S) impacts; (ii) the impacts are not unprecedented; few if any of them are irreversible or cumulative; they are limited to the project area; and (iii) since the borrower has inhouse capacity to manage the E&S risks, that can be successfully managed using good practice in an operational setting.Environmental and Social Instruments.The Project through an independent consultant has conducted an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and based on the findings of the ESIA, an Environmental, Social, Health and Safety Management Plan (ESMP) has been prepared that complies with country E&S requirements, AIIB ESP and aligns with good international industry practices (GIIP). A Livelihood Restoration Framework (LRF) has been developed to mitigate adverse economic impacts largely due to 12.8 km of transmission line. A detailed Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) will be prepared during the implementation stage based on training need assessment of the landowners.Environmental Aspects.The potential environmental impacts include impacts on the surface water bodies in immediate vicinity of the proposed site, changes in natural water drainage patterns can occur due to land levelling and infrastructure possibly affecting local hydrology, conversion of natural habitats or agricultural land can disrupt local ecosystems and wildlife habitats potentially leading to loss of biodiversity, soil compaction and erosion can occur during construction impacting soil health and water retention capacity resulting in increased pressure on the available water resources in the study region and the solar project park may act as a physical barrier for animals, disrupting their natural movement and feeding patterns. The ESIA study confirms the presence of approximately 100 to 120 trees within the study area, however most of these would be retained during the layout planning process as confirmed by the Borrower (SAEL Solar MHP1 Private Limited). There are also two non-perennial nala present within the site connecting the Penna River at approximately 1.8 km aerial distance from the site. No impacts are envisaged on the drainage as adequate buffer distance to natural drainage channels would be proposed as mitigation measures in the ESMP. To understand the likelihood of critical habitat for the Project, a Critical Habitat Screening was conducted using IBAT tool to identify threatened species likely to occur within or nearby the project area. The ESIA report provides interim details on the transmission line impacts which shall be updated by the consultant when the alignment and other technical details are finalized.Social Aspects.The Project will take 1,500 acres of private dry agriculture land on 29 years of long-term lease out of 1,881.32 acres identified for the Project. The Project has ensured that there is no physical displacement and no loss of and/or loss of access to public and private property. The ESIA evaluated the process of land lease to ensure that land taking process was fair and there are no legacy issues with the land. The ESIA also established that land leasing process has not resulted in physical displacement. The discussion with the landowners confirmed that majority of them have land outside of the leased land with irrigation facility. The transmission line will not lead to any physical displacement though there will be economic losses in terms of crop damages. During the construction phase of the project, nearly 200 construction workers will be employed at the project site. A Workers Management Plan (WMP) prepared by the Project will ensure that issues related to SEA/SH if any, are addressed properly. SAEL Industries at the corporate level has established the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) and the same will be applicable on the Project. The established ESMS has provisions and framework to ensure the labor rights and welfare covering both on-roll employees and contractual workers.Gender Aspects.The Project conducted gender analysis as part of the ESIA and based on that a Gender Action Plan (GAP) that aims to promote gender equality and address gender specific challenges has been prepared. It ensures that gender perspectives are integrated into all aspects of planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of projects to empower women, improve their access to opportunities, and reduce gender-based disparities. SAEL Industries had formulated the Policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment to create and maintain safe working environment for women at workplace. The policy mentions about the procedure for raising complaints, manner of inquiry, confidentiality etc. Two gender related indicators that will be monitored during the course of the Project include: (i) percentage of women and men employed and trained in project related roles; and (ii) changes in gender-based decision making power in the local communities.Occupational Health and Safety, Labor and Employment Conditions.The Project as part of the ESIA assessed health and safety risks to project workers and Project-affected communities, and measures have been put in place to prevent accidents, injuries and disease (including as appropriate, measures in line with internationally recognized standards to avoid or minimize exposure to communicable and noncommunicable diseases, including pandemics) associated with the Project.  Given that the Project involves a large scale construction, a WMP has been prepared as part of the ESIA. There are potential impacts and risks associated with supply chains in relation to labor and working conditions. SAEL Industries has mentioned to have an ESMS in line with IFC Performance Standards and World Bank EHS Guidelines. The Sponsor has shared copies of its Contract Management and Supply Chain Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, and E&S clauses to be provided in contract agreements (covering special clauses, and health and safety and labor clauses).Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure.The Project has identified stakeholders and consultation with the stakeholders were carried out to disseminate project information and to take their feedback on the project design, land procurement process, project’s resource requirement, project’s proposed activities, and social and environmental management plan. The feedback from the stakeholders have been incorporated in the design of the Project. To ensure continuous engagement with the stakeholders, the Project has developed SEP as part of ESMP that details out method of engagement, stages of engagement and purpose of engagement. The E&S instruments in English and summary in local language (Telugu) will be disclosed by SAEL Industries on its website and hard copies to be kept in the project area. This documentation will also be disclosed on AIIB’s website.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism.The Project will establish a multi-tier, gender responsive, culturally appropriate grievance redress mechanism (GRM) that will be accessible to the project affected individuals and communities free of cost. The Project will maintain the logbook of grievances received either in writing or verbal and also those recorded in the grievance register placed at the project site. The information of established GRM and AIIB’s Project Affected Peoples Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner. The status of grievances will be recorded and updated every week.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.Monitoring will be the responsibility of the Borrower and SAEL Industries supported by a qualified independent environmental and social advisory firm. The monitoring reports will be prepared semi-annually based on agreed formats and be provided to AIIB for review. The Bank will retain rights to conduct field supervision and monitoring visits during project implementation.",,Category B,OK

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been categorized as Category A, considering the significance of brine discharge to the marine environment from the operation of the desalination plants.Environmental and Social Instruments.An independent environmental and social (ES) consultant was hired by the Saudi Water Authority (SWA) to review its existing Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) against the requirements of AIIB’s ESP. As part of the ES due diligence (ESDD), the consultant also identified the associated facilities including water tanks and transmission lines, reviewed the domestic Environmental Impacts Assessment (EIA) reports of the desalination plants, and carried out desktop review and field inspection on the preparation and implementation of ES management plans during construction, commissioning or operation phases. Based on the ESDD findings as presented in the “Gap Assessment Report”, actions are proposed in the Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) to strengthen the ESMS and ES management at the desalination plants to align with AIIB’s ESP.Environmental Aspects.Given the construction of the two desalination plants and the associated facilities has been completed, the potential adverse environmental impacts are associated with plants commissioning and operation, which mainly include impacts to marine environment from brine discharge, treatment of domestic wastewater, disposal of solid waste, noise from pumps and other heavy machines, accidental oil spills, and energy consumption. The ESDD did not identify any environmental legacy issues from the construction phase. The key gaps are related to improving the procedures on the management of solid waste, wastewater, chemical storage and spill prevention, resource efficiency, and cascaded implementation of the ESMS at the plant and contractor level, for which actions were formulated in the ESAP. Moreover, the ESAP includes an action to develop and implement environmental monitoring plans for the two plants, covering monitoring of operation and maintenance (O&M) phase environmental impacts.Social Aspects.The Project is expected to generate positive impacts to local communities with better services and continuous clean water supply to meet the demand of the growing population. No impacts have been reported for land acquisition, involuntary (physical or economic) displacement, or heightened economic vulnerability. The ESDD did not identify any social legacy issues from the pre-and construction phases. Since the construction of the two desalination plants and the associated facilities has been completed as stated above, the potential social risks are only associated with the commissioning and operation of the plants. These impacts include labor and working conditions and health and safety risks for the nearby communities.Gender Aspects.SWA is committed to fostering human resources in the Kingdom, emphasizing the crucial role of women in the nation's resilience, aligned with Vision 2030 goals. SWA has certain gender-specific policies including women’s socioeconomic empowerment by increasing the number of female employees and female leadership, and for the prevention of gender-based violence (GBV). As per ESAP, SWA will include and implement gender-related actions through the strengthened ESMS.Occupational Health and Safety and Labor and Working Conditions.The ESDD reviewed the occupational health and safety (OHS) policy and procedures of SWA and the civil contractors, and the institutional arrangement for implementation, which is overall in compliance with AIIB’s ESP. No severe or serious OHS incident was reported during the construction phase. The ESDD identified gap-filling measures to be included in the ESMS and implemented during the Project implementation. The ESAP addresses these gaps and sets out the material measures and actions required for the Project to meet the ES requirements over a specified timeframe.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation and Information Disclosure. SWA conducted meetings in the Project area before initiating the construction activities, to inform the stakeholders about the Project activities and to solicit their comments and concerns. Going forward, SWA’s ESMS will be strengthened through the structured procedure to conduct stakeholder consultations during the commissioning and operation of the plants, therefore the ESAP includes an action to prepare and implement Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEP) for the two RO plants. The SEP will include the stakeholder identification and analysis of the Project and propose stakeholder engagement methods and program. In addition, SWA and AIIB have disclosed on their website the summary of the Gap Assessment Report and the ESAP.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).SWA has a whistleblowing department governed by the whistleblowing policy. Whistleblowing applies to all SWA staff and contractors. The department offers various uptake channels such as external and internal websites, hotline, email, and walk-ins. Grievances can be submitted anonymously. The GRM has the option of submitting anonymous or non-anonymous complaints. During the construction phase at the two RO plant sites, contractors maintained the site-specific grievance mechanisms. Contractors displayed a contact person and dedicated phone number on a noticeboard to lodge complaints. As per ESAP, the SWA will establish and disclose a corporate GRM in the two RO plants, including disclosing the information of AIIB’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM). SWA will provide regular reports on the GRM functioning with statistics.Monitoring Arrangements.The Client will submit ES monitoring reports based on the agreed format semi-annually during the first two years of operation and annually afterward to ensure the Project’s compliance with the ESAP and AIIB’s ESP.

As per the Bank’s ESP, the Project has been classified as Category A, due primarily to the scale and complexity of the involuntary resettlement involved. The environmental impacts and risks are typical of urban construction projects of this kind (large-scale housing schemes) as are the health and safety issues. These are expected to be temporary, manageable through adequate mitigation measures, and not irreversible. The social risks and impacts associated with the proposed Project are complex and are mainly related to: (i) the determination of land ownership in the areas to be acquired for sub-projects under Components 1 and 2; (ii) the need to ensure that people’s livelihoods are not adversely affected by the move to the new sites; (iii) ensuring people will adapt to life in high-rise apartment blocks and safeguarding the long-term viability of the housing complexes and services; and (iv) the need to identify and engage with the affected households and other stakeholders, including people living near the new housing schemes, from the beginning of the Project (especially the need to facilitate the active participation of women, young people and people of different ethnic and socio-economic groups). These issues will be addressed through the post-resettlement and other social programs (currently implemented by the UDA) and will be further enhanced under Component 3.In accordance with the Bank’s ESP and national policy requirements, the Borrower and the UDA have prepared a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF) and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) that set out the general principles for managing the social and environmental impacts, especially the resettlement and post-resettlement measures needed to ensure that the standards of living and livelihoods of the households that are relocated can be enhanced or, at the very least, restored. The draft RPF and ESMPF were disclosed in English, Sinhala and Tamil versions on the websites of theUDA, MMWD andAIIB.Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) will be prepared for each of the sub-projects under Component 1, including the two or three sub-projects to be identified for the 1,400 new units for families that have yet to be identified, and will have to be reviewed and approved by the Bank and disclosed by the Bank and UDA during project implementation The ESMPs must be approved by the Bank and disclosed before the construction contracts are signed. The sub-projects under Component 2 will be covered by the RAPs for Component 1, since the Component 2 sites have either been or are being vacated under the current URP program or will be vacated when the families from these sites move to the housing units constructed under Component 1. The RAPs will focus on the site-specific issues related to each resettlement project. It should be noted that most of the resettlement sites are located close to (less than a kilometer), and in some cases, are immediately adjacent to, the areas they originally occupied. Two RAPs have been prepared for Obeyesekerepura and Madampityahereandhere.Under the guidance of the ESMPF, the ESMP will be prepared for each sub-project site. The ESMPs will analyze the potential environmental and social risks and impacts related to the project activities (during and after construction). The ESMPs will also propose measures needed to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and to improve the environmental and social performance of the Project. During preparation of the ESMPs, public consultation will be carried out with identified stakeholders, namely with the project-affected people, to seek their views, concerns and feedback, to further enhance the project design and mitigation measures.A project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) is in place to allow project-affected people to raise their concerns and resolve outstanding issues.",,Category A,OK

ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) are applicable. Given that the Project will be implemented in phases and the exact locations will be determined as detailed designs for different Project components are prepared during the implementation stage of the Project, a framework approach has been adopted, and an Environmental and Social Management Planning Framework (ESMPF) has been developed for both Phase I and Phase II Projects, which includes a generic Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a Resettlement Planning Framework (RPF). The purpose of the ESMPF is to ensure that the proposed project activities are assessed and implemented in conformity with the policies of the Republic of Uzbekistan as well as the AIIB’s ESP and ESSs. The ESMPF identifies generic impacts of the project activities and identifies generic mitigation measures to address these impacts. The ESMPF and RPF provide policy, methodology and procedures for environmental and social (ES) studies of the site-specific activities.Environmental aspects.The Project is expected to generate benefits in terms of improving the efficiency of water use and enhancing water environment and public health security in the Bukhara Region. The Project will cause temporary adverse environmental impacts during construction and operations. These impacts would include damage to crops, generation of solid wastes including hazardous wastes, noise, dust, air pollution, wastewater, impacts on cultural heritage, disturbance to community and traffic, damage to public utilities, influx of labor, health hazards and labor safety issues due to facility siting, civil works and operation and maintenance. Mitigation measures to address these adverse impacts and occupational health and safety issues are included in the generic ESMP and will be specified in site-specific ESMPs. In addition, third-party monitoring consultants will be engaged by the Project to develop semi-annual Environmental and Social Monitoring Reports. The Environmental and Social Monitoring Reports will focus on the implementation of the ESMPs.Climate change.This Project aims to improve the efficiency of water use and sustainable water management in the Bukhara Region. The measures proposed under the Project are expected to help the communities to better adapt to the scarcity of water resources due to climate change, and to improve energy efficiency of the facilities, which will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions during operation.Social and gender aspects.It is possible that people using the lands of proposed facilities, both title holders and non-title holders will be physically or economically displaced. During the process of detailed design, efforts will be made to avoid or minimize the physical and economic displacement. The Project-affected People’s (PAP’s) income/livelihood loss will be compensated in accordance with the provisions of ESS 2 and the principles set out in the RPF. Women and children will be specific beneficiaries of this Project due to the household connections of clean and safe water supply. A survey has been carried out to prepare a Gender Action Plan (GAP), which will be updated during the implementation of this Project.Stakeholder engagement, consultation, and information disclosure.Stakeholder consultations have been carried out during the preparation of the ESMPF in the form of focus group discussions, interviews and workshops. The ESMPF also sets out procedures and requirements on stakeholder engagement, public consultation and information disclosure at site-specific level during the implementation of the Project. The ESMPF in English and Russian languages and the Executive Summary in Uzbek have been disclosed on the website of Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (and later on thewebsiteof the new Project Implementing Entity JSC Uzsuvtaminot) since Jan 31, 2020 and the links are made available on the AIIBwebsite. Hardcopies of the documents in the two local languages are also available in the project area. Once the site-specific ESIAs, ESMPs and RPs are prepared and approved, they will also be disclosed in a similar manner.GRM.A two-tier Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) for PAPs at the field-level and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) level has been proposed in accordance with the requirements of AIIB’s ESP. A separate GRM for workers will deal exclusively with those complaints that involve workers for construction activities. The PCU-level GRM has been established during the implementation of the ongoing AIIB-supported Phase I project, which will be used for Phase II project if AIIB is satisfied with its performance. The field-level GRMs will be established when the Supervision Consultants and Contractors for the respective phases of this Project are onboard. Information of established project-level GRM including Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) of AIIB in local languages will be timely disclosed to project-affected people in an appropriate manner.",,Category A,OK

However, this area is currently connected to the national grid network by a transmission line over 45 years old, which has reliability issues. Given the potential of that region, the CEB has planned to construct a new transmission network from the New Habarana Grid substation to the Kappalthurai Grid substation with financial support from AIIB, emphasizing the need for transmission network capacity expansion in the project area. The following activities are planned in the project scope:Construction of around 77-km 220kV double circuit transmission line from New Habarana GSS to Kappalthurai GSSAugmentation and modification of New Habarana GSS (220/132 kV) and Kappalthurai GSS (220/33 kV)","Applicable Policy and Categorization.AIIB's Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), including the Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), applies to this project. ESS1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) and ESS2 (Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement) apply, while ESS3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not applicable. The scope of the project is to construct a double circuit, 220kV transmission line from New Habarana to Kappalthurai, which is about 77 km in length. The project has been classified as Category B following the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), as there are a limited number of potentially adverse environmental and social (ES) impacts, these impacts are not unprecedented or irreversible and can be managed through operational good international practice.Environmental and Social Instruments.An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) has been prepared based on Sri Lanka’s National Regulations. This IEE has been approved by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Currently, consultants have been mobilized to prepare an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) report, including an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) to align to AIIB ESF. Further, instruments will be identified and prepared as necessary according to the preliminary results of the ESIA.Environment Aspects.The project alignment will mostly traverse to paddy fields, and some forest patches. This has already been closely coordinated with Sri Lanka’s Forest Department to ensure an alignment route with lesser impacts to the biodiversity. Initial anticipated impacts for the project will not result in a significant loss of flora species as they are neither unique nor restricted to the project area habitats and will not cause serious disruption of migratory routes for fauna species. During the construction phase, the impacts anticipated for the project includes accumulation of hazardous wastes, pollution risks to surface and groundwater, and soil, tree loss, topsoil erosion, dust emissions and effects to noise and vibrations. Impacts during operation include possible collision of mammals and birds and bats to the transmission towers and cables. This ESIA will identify and address risks and impacts of the project through physical environment, ecological and critical habitat assessment.Social Aspects.Land will be required for the tower footing, which may include from farmers that use land as a primary source of income. There is also a risk of livelihood disruption during construction due to reduced access to land and farming activities. The project has been designed to minimize the number of households affected by the project and will avoid the need for resettlement. Vulnerable groups, including seasonal worker, female-headed households, low-income households, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facing potential livelihood disruption and risks related to worker influx will be identified in the ESIA, and additional instruments prepared as needed. These will be reviewed by AIIB to ensure compliance with AIIB’s ESP.Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The health and safety risks to local communities are expected during the implementation phase given that construction will occur on land which is adjacent to schools, roads, and houses, and on farming land with heavy footfall during harvest season. Unskilled labor will be sourced from seasonal workers in local communities, but skilled labor is expected to be externally recruited, creating risks related to labor influx. There are also risks relating to OHS and working conditions such as working at height, live power lines and lightning strike risks. The ESIA will elaborate further and recommend the necessary instruments to avoid and mitigate risks, including OHS, community health and safety, traffic, child abuse and gender-based violence (GBV)/ sexual exploitation (SE)/ sexual harassment (SH), and labor and working conditions.Stakeholder Engagement, Consultation, and Information Disclosure.The key stakeholders include government, farmer organizations, and community members, including those from vulnerable and marginalized groups. Initial consultations identified a low awareness amongst community members around the development benefits of transmission lines, and concerns surrounding adverse health effects of the proposed infrastructure. Further consultations will be conducted to inform the preparation of the ESIA. ES documentation prepared for the project will be timely disclosed to the local communities by the client in an appropriate manner. AIIB will also disclose those ES documentation at its website timely.Project Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).Building on the existing complaint mechanisms of CEB, a two-tier GRM will be constituted for the project in line with the Bank’s ESP. Communities and individuals who believe they are adversely affected by the project will be able to submit complaints to the project-level GRM for resolution. In addition to the above GRM for addressing complaints from the local community, a commensurate mechanism will be made available at the contractor level for workers' grievances. The information of established GRMs and Bank’s Project-affected People’s Mechanism (PPM) will be timely disclosed in an appropriate manner.Monitoring and Supervision Arrangements.The PMU will be fully responsible for monitoring the project's implementation and is expected to prepare progress reports semi-annually based on agreed format highlighting progress on the implementation of ES plans. During implementation of the project, the Bank will conduct regular field supervision missions to monitor and verify the progress. The frequency of the missions will depend on implementation progress and complexity.",USD35 million,Category B,OK

To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing environmental and social (ES) aspects of the Project, and as permitted by AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (AIIB’s ESP), EBRD’s Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD’s ESP 2019) and relevant Performance Requirements (PRs) will apply to this Project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP (consistent with above referred two earlier projects). AIIB has reviewed the EBRD’s ESP and PRs and is satisfied that: (i) they are consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including AIIB’s Environmental and Social Exclusion List and the relevant ES Standards; and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project. EBRD has categorized the ES risks of the project as Category A (which is equivalent to Category A if AIIB’s ESP were applicable).Environmental and Social Instruments.As required by the ESP of EBRD, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was prepared to address the anticipated ES risks and impacts in the Project Components and associated facilities and remediation of any issues including legacy issues. The ESIA also includes a cumulative impact assessment, Noise and Air Pollution assessments, Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), Corrective Action Plan (CAP) prepared based on land audit undertaken to assess the resettlement impacts so far and identify measures to address any gaps with EBRD’s PR5. The ESIA is applicable to the long-term financing (LTF) stage as well, as the risks and impacts are duly assessed in the ESIA. The Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) prepared to address the gaps between the Project mitigation measures and the EBRD’s ESP requirements is updated to reflect the residual and applicable time bound actions to be implemented during the LTF project period.Environmental Aspects.The Project does not involve any additional activities beyond the initial project and only facilitates LTF. The construction phase related ES risks and impacts such as dust emissions, water contamination, noise, removal of construction debris, etc. are being managed through the implementation of the ESMP or ESAP. The quarterly reports of Independent Lenders’ ES Consultant (IESC) confirmed that the ESAP implementation is on course without any material deviations. At the peak of construction activities in January 2024 a construction labor audit was conducted, and no major non-compliances were identified. In January 2025 a second audit was carried out in respect of demobilization phase of construction and the corrective actions are included in the LTF ESAP. For the operational phase during the LTF period, the major environmental impacts are cumulative noise impact, air pollution, solid waste (including hazard waste), and wastewater. ESAP is revised to reflect operational stage impacts and includes ES screening of associated facilities as per Management of Change Plan and identification of measures to manage impacts. Noise management plan and Voluntary noise insulation program is under review and revision by experts. Assessment of the houses eligible under VNIP is part of ESAP and will be completed by July 2025.The webpage of the Antalya airport facilitates capturing noise related grievances by the community and stakeholders.Social Aspects.A land acquisition audit was conducted during the ESIA process and a CAP in the form of supplementary livelihood improvement plan (SLIP) is prepared providing a detailed and specific implementation plan to mitigate the vulnerabilities of Project-affected People (PAPs) following the earlier pre-Project expropriation process. SLIP is a detailed implementation plan inclusive of a vulnerable people’s program, a house improvement program, a greenhouse program and an employability enhancement program and details on grievance redress mechanisms. LTF ESAP includes review of the SLIP, based on first half year of implementation. A Community Liaison Officer (CLO) is engaged for the Project to support effective implementation of SLIP as well as coordinate grievance redressal. The SLIP programs are expected to be accomplished by 2029-2030.Gender.The potential occupational and community health and safety risks, including those related to labor influx and Gender-Based violence, sexual exploitation, assault, and harassment (GBV-SEAH), were assessed in line with EBRD’s PR4. A standalone Gender-Based Violence and Harassment Due Diligence (GBVH) was prepared to capture various actions, including the involvement of women in project planning and execution. GRM includes any complaint, suggestion or request on GBVH cases, allowing anonymous complaints to be registered and assessed. As part of implementation, a gender focal person is assigned to manage and coordinate GBVH related issues as well as act as a direct contact for GBVH related complaints.Community, and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions.The ESIA identified occupational health and safety (OHS) risks during the construction and O&M phases. The OHS requirements are included in the contractor's site-specific Environment Management Plans (EMPs). Similarly, issues related to the influx of labor and code of conduct have been addressed in the EMPs.

To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the E&S risks and impacts of the Project, and as permitted under AIIB's Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), the WB's ESF will apply to the Project in lieu of AIIB's ESP. AIIB has reviewed the WB's ESF and is satisfied that: (i) it is consistent with the Bank’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with AIIB's ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List and relevant Environmental and Social Standards; and (ii) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the Project.Under the WB’s ESF, the Project has been assigned “High Risk”.As specific sites, scale, and designs of the two WTPs and several OHSRs are not fully known at this stage, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been prepared in accordance with WB’s ESF. The ESMF and RPF (in English and their Executive Summaries in local language, Gurmukhi) have been disclosed on the websites of the Borrower (hereandhere) andWorld Bankand links will be provided on AIIB’s project website. Based on the RPF, site-specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared once the detailed designs of the subprojects are available.The environmental risk of the project is classified as “substantial” because of the risks and impacts related to: (i) construction of water intakes from canals; (ii) construction of water treatment plants; (iii) laying of clean water transmission lines between WTPs and OHSRs; and (iv) construction of OHSRs and repairs of existing OHSRs (v) disposal of sludge from the WTPs during operation phase; (vi) emission of dust, noise, debris, waste products during construction; and (vii) health and safety of workers and traffic disruption during construction of WTPs and OHSRs. Under component 3 for COVID-19 Crisis Response, it will not involve any new infrastructure and it will finance short to medium term priorities from a positive list of eligible expenditures that will be covered in the Project Operation Manual (POM). The environmental risks and impacts will be mitigated through the preparation of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and ESMPs once the detailed designs of the subprojects are available.The social risks and impacts likely to arise include: (i) permanent and temporary land acquisition and related livelihood impacts to both title and nontitle holders; (ii) impacts due to labor influx and migrant laborers, including Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA); (iii) exclusion of vulnerable communities from project benefits and lack of meaningful engagement with communities, particularly vulnerable groups, that may be related to COVID-19 restrictions. These risks will be mitigated in accordance with the provisions of the ESMPs, RAPs and SEA Action plan.The Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) identifies relevant stakeholders, including vulnerable groups, and strategies to engage with them in the context of COVID-19 will be implemented.
